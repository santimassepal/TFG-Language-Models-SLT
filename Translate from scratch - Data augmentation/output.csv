the union needs also to take the the the but but take . . . <EOS>
we are therefore support to the countries of their support and in country . <EOS>
furthermore it is good that the need to the energy policy policy . <EOS>
for example the is not not the . . . . . <EOS>
that is why important and the european parliament and the that is is . . . . . . <EOS>
the fact that the report the the the the on the the the of by the <EOS>
all these these are important important in the report . report . <EOS>
a also can also also . . this . . <EOS>
the eu has the role role to the role of the crisis . <EOS>

however it has a responsibility to the the to to . . <EOS>
the eu has the a the the the in the <EOS>
it is a with with with in and and report report report and not report report report . . . . <EOS>
one serious the is is one of the the that we we . . . . <EOS>
this will continue continue to the eu s continue as a result of the world . <EOS>
over the main of the is is over <EOS>
this means more more for the million million . . <EOS>
when we will already when this be when the in when be new be ? <EOS>
the eu cannot to the that policy is . . . . . . <EOS>
as there there just a more more there are the and the <EOS>
however we cannot support which in which which which which which <EOS>
it does the to on on on the and and to the . . . . <EOS>
indeed it is important that we and we . . <EOS>
i have chosen chosen to the report because the report has been place in place . <EOS>
we are seen this particular of the fundamental part of the the in . <EOS>
we agree with the report with the the the the <EOS>
a need for a policy of such a and and <EOS>
however there is also a with with with which which we cannot the <EOS>
that is why we . . <EOS>
the the the the the the eu there should be be the eu the eu . . . <EOS>
with the report the the the the the . . <EOS>
i welcome welcome the report report and welcome this report on in . <EOS>
for the the of we have been been the the the the . . <EOS>

this is a for of the the of the the the must take <EOS>
the have have have already the the which to have to the <EOS>
the and and security issue is important important . <EOS>
this is a fundamental of production production in the . . . . <EOS>
if policy does not should be able to this policy be be should . . . . . <EOS>
they put because the people for on people on <EOS>

that is why we have voted . <EOS>
when it would also have some some of some when it some . <EOS>

today we have voted against the on this today . <EOS>
it is very difficult . <EOS>
this this on on on is on the on on the of the and and and and <EOS>
the is is most to the most to . . <EOS>
to proposal the proposal proposal for for to and and the . . <EOS>
we cannot in favour of this . . <EOS>
from more more more from the for the the the the are from commission . . . . <EOS>
we cannot afford in the ! <EOS>
the report s report s the the <EOS>
a of a of a a of a it a <EOS>
the european which which which be made be not <EOS>
it is vital a vital that the fund are to achieve a solution on . <EOS>
mr mr mr barroso can the the that i that mr <EOS>
the directive directive directive directive directive directive directive on the directive directive the directive and the directive of the directive . <EOS>
that is why we have voted . <EOS>
up the up up up up up up on the up up up up the . up up . <EOS>
we need to into into economic economic we which we are economic economic we . . <EOS>
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes <EOS>
approval of minutes of the previous sitting see minutes <EOS>
security and and and and security of <EOS>
we now the us are to our in is . <EOS>
it is true true that could could the from from . . . <EOS>
one of the main of the the the one of is also . . <EOS>
as a european said in european said it has a against against it a in . . <EOS>
the the should be the the the the within the within the the of the . . <EOS>
i therefore therefore to to the with with the with the with the the the . <EOS>
i do not think need to do further on on . . <EOS>
this makes makes a number of the united states in to make a <EOS>
it is also also true by that the commission states in the states on . . <EOS>
the first time for the out the can be be be out <EOS>
in this at this at a . . . <EOS>
if this would work would be be be be would it would would it <EOS>
that is not the case . <EOS>
we still however a further way to the of in in . . . <EOS>
our priority is to ensure the safety of the safety and the children safety the children to the <EOS>
it will do to to the to to to . . <EOS>
this dialogue has nothing to nothing with nothing nothing . <EOS>
that is one the is the that the is the one . . . . . <EOS>
this means which and the issue of which which can take be and <EOS>
let us not forget that the fact is a fact . <EOS>
yet this cannot cannot a more which which which which cannot <EOS>
finally from the has have been been important for for one the the the the and the <EOS>
all we have done the best in order we do to do <EOS>
we believe that we have a fundamental safety of fundamental rights and for the for the . . . <EOS>
we voted in favour of . <EOS>
we are also also in in european european . . . . . <EOS>
we see the way for the of as as people the . . . <EOS>
such such such such such such as such such such such is are . . . . . <EOS>
we cannot agree that that there is to the to the . . . . <EOS>
mr president i am not in favour of any from the not not or not or . <EOS>
children must be be from from to for the . . . . <EOS>
it was right right to right here for children . <EOS>
there is no about about about about about legal in in can . . . <EOS>
it is therefore therefore to be to how how how how how a and all . . <EOS>
the the that that we are in not the the . . . <EOS>
this report does not about about about about about about not not not . . . <EOS>
a is not but but but but but we are but but <EOS>
the vote will therefore the vote against this this be . . . <EOS>
such a and and have from and have from and from and and . . . . <EOS>
however i would like to make this more in . . <EOS>
of course this will will the of . . <EOS>
if would something the one would that would to s s to s to <EOS>
will it will then be possible to the the how the <EOS>
at present states are still is a very member issue . <EOS>
has have a the the a the which which has to to a the <EOS>
commissioner our children s safety we we . . . . . <EOS>
today we are most step . <EOS>
they are from so from and so so so that are <EOS>
so so today has has a . <EOS>
this is because because because of these issues are when these issues . <EOS>
in this with this with that that there will be be be be will . . <EOS>
these are in these and against against and and . . . . . <EOS>
may this may the of a situation situation of may the be <EOS>
in order to this this example should should should should <EOS>
there there no no there are no . . . <EOS>
i just wish to one the the the the report <EOS>
the number of human number of human rights are that the are <EOS>
we have now to take the the right of the the and the take . <EOS>
this report is one of one step of the european one of the s and the in in . . <EOS>
i agree with one that the proposal proposal a one . . . <EOS>
in short should should be a be of in this regard . <EOS>
however what would mean by public public by or as well ? <EOS>
how would would be that ? <EOS>
i think that we to say a the a or or or . . <EOS>
so current it is that such who are a the such a . . <EOS>

one is one one one one of the one and the are . . . <EOS>
this is a good example example how good example to the . . . . <EOS>
this is a more basis of the european parliament and the european parliament . <EOS>
in addition of the system must the the . . <EOS>
to information information information information information information information to make information information information information information information . <EOS>
finally finally proposal the proposal proposal for the the the of the . . <EOS>
the have the and to to the to this <EOS>
if most most most most important most important most most we are most most most most most . . <EOS>
the the of will continue us to the the in . <EOS>
when we need to to the and and are not not situation the situation situation . <EOS>
the is already a for for information information . . <EOS>
the first people that the is at . . . <EOS>
in this situation we are both both both and . <EOS>
it also result in the . <EOS>
these is is particularly important for their people are to the people to . <EOS>
the must must be be the . . . . <EOS>
only this will only be only to the the system in . . . <EOS>
this proposal proposal the very and and to . . . <EOS>
it requires a from importance from a fundamental importance of which on their own . <EOS>
i hope that i have the european parliament for support for parliament this resolution . <EOS>
thank you very much . <EOS>
that is not going to the that we are going going to be going . <EOS>
but we are looking at now that that has now to the that . . <EOS>

so it is a important that we have more a we <EOS>
i would therefore like to thank for for us for us this of we this . . . <EOS>
commissioner commissioner has mentioned the number of the number of the number of the issue . <EOS>
i must also stress that the point of the in this regard . <EOS>
a a is a it a a . . <EOS>
the report is the into but there is the the into into . . . . . . <EOS>
our group make us make a very opportunity to make this on on <EOS>
the same applies which on the other the the and which which which to have the <EOS>
the is is a in . . . . . <EOS>
we all all that the who are the most about . . <EOS>
the states can the time states but the even the even the <EOS>
you ask for the money of the other market . <EOS>
we cannot allow us to allow us to the with we with with we with <EOS>
i believe that that this very but here very be be here . . . . <EOS>
the proposal proposal on on on on information information information information information information and information . <EOS>
as said said said this said said said said said that said . <EOS>
madam president i would like to thank the for the the . . <EOS>
i think it is a good example to the that . . . . <EOS>
from a from from the are from from are the <EOS>
as for a like would like the would like would to to . <EOS>
i have really a issue issue issue . <EOS>
when the commission commission is for for for for a the of is <EOS>
i would therefore like us to draw us to the us in . . . . <EOS>
as the current the also also also the current to this current we . . . <EOS>
there is there a large of the in . <EOS>
the would would be be be . . <EOS>
finally i would like like to say something about about . <EOS>
there are in but but there there very many we . . . <EOS>
i would like like to be the for the for . . . <EOS>
many we will will about about about about in in in in in . . <EOS>
that is why the european union has been the the on the the . . . <EOS>
let this is us to to . . <EOS>
this is not a as as as as there as <EOS>
however it also as as with with with a with . . . <EOS>
i do not want to see for the the of of . . <EOS>
i am therefore pleased that this proposal proposal to achieve this proposal . <EOS>
in this case already already a further . <EOS>
in example we have for example of the the . . <EOS>
it is part of part of this is that is . . <EOS>
madam president would would like two like to put to <EOS>
my question a question in the the to the the the . . <EOS>
the is were the the that that the . . . . . <EOS>
could not there there be a time for the who are not not the the the the <EOS>
some years ago we have already ago ago . <EOS>
that concludes as a human human rights as . <EOS>
i am just pleased just at the the of has been been in . . <EOS>
i am now some serious the the the for in for the <EOS>
i should now more there there should be more now now now . <EOS>
they should have the at at at with the the their with their at . . <EOS>
finally i have also with with with with with with with the the in the in . . . <EOS>
could commissioner commissioner commissioner commissioner ? <EOS>
on it is the the and it be be be and in . . . . <EOS>
we will not any this . . . <EOS>
the must have been on on the the that the by the . . . . . <EOS>
it must be and and there be be be and to . . . . . <EOS>
i do not understand how that the current could this be done . <EOS>
mr barroso have the question of the . <EOS>
i must not clearly that this matter of the matter of this matter is not <EOS>
i fully in your opinion opinion . <EOS>
the issue of the is the to to to <EOS>
the result of are not not as the as . . . <EOS>
the are is for for for a . . . . <EOS>
there is no question question the question of measures to . <EOS>
this is simply a further . . <EOS>
however this is not information information to information to . . <EOS>
these can can make these that information on on information . . <EOS>
this requires member states states a <EOS>
however these focus on the to the and to . . <EOS>
i think another another is another another example of my country for example . <EOS>
these are not not only to for are for . . . . . . <EOS>
yes it does a . <EOS>
the european are not not . . . <EOS>
this is where where problem problem . <EOS>
i think these is very in cases cases . <EOS>
for example not not not not to to to to to to the out . . . . <EOS>
and and different are different different different . <EOS>
however i will be able to this problem problem problem . . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
and and debate of the <EOS>
during there were the there there there some some some some also the on some . . . . <EOS>
what we are looking is the of are . . <EOS>
it is also true a that there was actually . <EOS>
it is when it is when it is that the to is to . . . <EOS>
it is a to by by it . <EOS>
finally the very the the the to to be be to the the . . <EOS>
you have to to that that eur system eur system . <EOS>
this means is also important that it is to the by the the and the . . . . . <EOS>
a very very at least is not a at . <EOS>
this legislation therefore are to to the the protection of . <EOS>
that is why the the the the the are . . <EOS>
a other rights are used use of use . <EOS>
all all of the rapporteur is very in in the . . <EOS>
it will be the s s s s to be be . . . . <EOS>
this well . <EOS>
this is a fact before the fact before the last before the last . <EOS>
we are now a for the market . <EOS>
we are for for the and and and we who are in in . . . . . . . . . <EOS>
there is no doubt that there is a to the when there is . . <EOS>
and and and use of the subject of be able to be . . . <EOS>
these member states states must which member states and for the rules for . . <EOS>
the course will be only be be course after . they have been course . <EOS>
the measures measures to place measures from the measures must place place . <EOS>
in when of the of must must must be must be . . . <EOS>
mr barroso the that mr barroso the with the the the the the . <EOS>
i also believe that this compromise . good good compromise . <EOS>
i was therefore in the the commission the the on the on to the on on the . <EOS>
obviously often is often by out the out they are out by the they are out . <EOS>
this is a matter for that it be be to be and and . . . <EOS>
i writing the us that we have the the on on on at . . <EOS>
as we have been been with with with with with . <EOS>
they are and and their with with . . . . . . . <EOS>
under the under their their they their to to use their their to . . . . . <EOS>
if this does does if if if if we do some even even . . <EOS>
there is no possible way for a way to use . of . <EOS>
i am pleased in that there has been there are the . . <EOS>
different different is different different . <EOS>
these these are right in right of the . . <EOS>
i i i that have the the in in . . <EOS>

written explanations of vote <EOS>
but this means with one of but but but not but not as cannot . <EOS>
the issue of the the in of in . . <EOS>
this report makes a significant step in the report . <EOS>
for these these reasons . <EOS>
the therefore the security security security is therefore there . . . <EOS>
this proposal is proposal by the european council by the european council and the european commission . <EOS>
how are the the right of <EOS>
are they or their years or ? ? <EOS>
such such such are is to . . . . <EOS>
firstly i welcome out the of a system of <EOS>
they want to the the the of the . . <EOS>
this is not a way way to . . . <EOS>
that is why i me . <EOS>
i voted in favour of the the by . <EOS>
at the also take at . . . <EOS>
the will will take the the at of at at the <EOS>
is not this more it is not than it <EOS>
we believe that the and and the should not be be be . . . <EOS>
this is a eur billion of eur . . <EOS>
mr schulz has proposed a that that i can the that mr union . <EOS>
all it all a all put and it put a great of the <EOS>
these points points these points of the basis of our are on <EOS>
for these these these reasons on on the the the . <EOS>
finally i agree with with with with the the between . <EOS>
the protection of protection must take these protection of the protection . <EOS>
this is as as as as . . . <EOS>
a to the to the on on on the on the the on on on on the the the be to the . . . . <EOS>
i consider it a to to a to european of european european european european european <EOS>
it should only been in favour of the report report that the report report and the . . <EOS>
i voted in favour of the report . <EOS>
thus of human rights should that the rights that should . . . <EOS>
for these reasons are reasons to vote in this report report report . . . <EOS>
every year of their member states are in in . . . <EOS>
in fact of the the the and the and also and . . <EOS>
for this reason reason i could in today s today . . . . <EOS>
that is something i cannot agree to . <EOS>
the have already already already good of rights on on on on <EOS>
it is not people and people not not . . <EOS>
the member states is not the the states states the and . . . <EOS>
it has been clear for that the the this on on both and to the have been in <EOS>
member states should with the on with the the member states to the the to the <EOS>
this eu should should should should be be be the the . . . . <EOS>
i no no particular for this resolution . <EOS>
fr mr report mr report s report report report the . . <EOS>
very much the union are for for between women between women and women . and . <EOS>
such to my such such in in are also . . . . <EOS>
the situation is also the the in other countries countries have also . . <EOS>
for these these reasons the the the . <EOS>
i voted against because i am because i against against against i against against . <EOS>
on the contrary of their their they are importance to the european union and the european union . <EOS>
the problem is that problem problem that he has to the problem problem . . <EOS>
why is why this ? ? <EOS>
it is because for the european to to to are fundamental fundamental or fundamental . <EOS>
if they are to be should the if they should the the the . . . <EOS>
in addition such with the states such such . . <EOS>
it is therefore nothing more than and nothing should come . <EOS>
such such such in are the for for european union for the european union . . . <EOS>
i do not think in but but it is a in . . <EOS>
and and member states have the to the member states states to <EOS>
in fact the european parliament is to to national the national system . <EOS>
to the right of their citizens are right in right . <EOS>
in this case we can only view we can take a fundamental rights and that . <EOS>
in writing of my group i believe my own opinion . <EOS>
however with with to say however would like it to <EOS>
my human rights the in fact of human rights <EOS>
to the with the the and <EOS>
there is only a way way to them . they . <EOS>
for these reasons reasons the report the in in report . . . <EOS>
the role of is the fundamental the the the european union . . . <EOS>
finally of lisbon will not not the the the the situation of the the the in of rights . . <EOS>
support for this report does not not support for for that the treaty . <EOS>
therefore the report is to the report with in regard to the report . . . <EOS>
for the reason of the the the the the on on on on on which on rights the the . <EOS>
free free and free in the and and and be to be and to . . <EOS>
a debate of the the and the of and this debate and to <EOS>
firstly there is a national level of national national national level . <EOS>
these on these are the . . <EOS>
for the and and i i against report against this report . . <EOS>
i voted against it . <EOS>
europe has set to the and and the the . . <EOS>
the have been been in for for example of for and would have the <EOS>
we must also ensure that the rights to ensure is the social rights . <EOS>
and rights rights are on on on fundamental human rights . <EOS>
we must one of every and every and we . every <EOS>
the european union has been with with fundamental fundamental rights . . <EOS>
let us make it that is a ! <EOS>
european union union for democracy and rule . <EOS>
one is one of one one of its union s union s s s s one of <EOS>

in its opinion its opinion and cannot cannot . . <EOS>
we should therefore be very very about about about are about about about very the the of the the the . <EOS>
i wish by by the on the the by on the . . . <EOS>
it is a for the of states to to the the . . . . <EOS>

however a objective of a is was by the a in . . . <EOS>
furthermore the is is a and and <EOS>
can and can be be be when when when when when when s s s <EOS>
there is no other way . <EOS>
any country is a better step of the the . . <EOS>
the the the must the and the and and to the <EOS>
despite the european union from the european parliament from on the the the <EOS>
we have an immediate however between however between and the new of however . <EOS>
yet we have no the of . . <EOS>
what is at the council at the time of this ? ? <EOS>
we have here and and and we must with council here with we we . . <EOS>
it is necessary to the ensure of a long term and the long term is necessary . <EOS>
it is no reason that there has no no to to to the solution . <EOS>
the swedish presidency to the the the of the . . <EOS>

we can no longer no longer no in the . . <EOS>
a is a and and not . <EOS>
those who have been who who who have been . . <EOS>
the the is is to to to the the of the . . <EOS>
in this way we and and we therefore are needed to achieve we need . <EOS>
it is there there there that between there is between between between between between and and . . . <EOS>
i urge this president of the the the and and we the in of and . <EOS>
i believe that we need to situation situation situation . . . <EOS>
i believe that that the is the the . . <EOS>
however in addition we and we to to the the the . . . <EOS>
we are not because because that we make in that are made . <EOS>
mr president in a the during the the during the has during during . . . <EOS>
it has a for and and for have . . <EOS>
the s policy policy policy policy is also to the policy policy policy . . . <EOS>
this must stop . <EOS>
it should be a . . . <EOS>
this is a issue for respect respect respect respect . <EOS>
it is a issue of . . <EOS>
so they should . . <EOS>
therefore we should not further at the of of and . . . <EOS>
in addition process must must be be be . . . . . <EOS>
we are looking at many the victims of the victims of the victims . <EOS>
we and and there there are at so many so many of the same <EOS>
not the been also responsible for that the that of the ? <EOS>
i three years when when when of years was years ago . <EOS>
she can right by the right of the right are right ! <EOS>
it is a course of course a international law of international law . <EOS>
international the community of the the <EOS>
when a national rights when of it has been as well <EOS>
we need the for the the the . . . . . <EOS>
it is not just a that that the not not not not not . . <EOS>
i can no no for for the no of on on on <EOS>
we must consider our children to the on on on on on <EOS>
mr president s presidency s on on s and and and <EOS>
the current of the the and and the the <EOS>
i have not to the the the the of the the <EOS>
i do not think it is a time to do so . <EOS>
in fact still still as a as as . . <EOS>
i have seen it in . <EOS>
i have had it in . <EOS>
i have it place many in place . <EOS>
that concludes . <EOS>
all all all has have all to all as has . . <EOS>
i think it is not important to give the european the the on this which up up the european union . . <EOS>
i think we should think about about about about it is about . . <EOS>
i know how question is how . <EOS>
we are in with with the . . . <EOS>
we do do do do do they work to do they are work . <EOS>
there is how on the we can the in . . <EOS>
those who those who are on on the the and we who us <EOS>
it is not us should not us to give we we . . . . . <EOS>
they have to to the and we . . <EOS>
that is was the out to the out out . . <EOS>
i welcome the one of which which is is to the for the the . . <EOS>
it is a very good good of we should be good . it . <EOS>
this could really a need up a really up could could could up . <EOS>
mrs malmstrom and mrs malmstrom from mrs others . <EOS>
this means with with with with and how to be be to . . . . <EOS>
we are on with with on the and then then we then with with with with with the <EOS>
there is a about there about about there there there . <EOS>
this can be only if the if the the the the to . . . . <EOS>
for the we have the important important and to important the the important and and . <EOS>
what can be be to the ? <EOS>
let us be very little let us . <EOS>
i think it is also a the current . <EOS>
european union can therefore can . . <EOS>
it can in way as a as such as . <EOS>
do the do do we want to the the to do to to <EOS>
no <EOS>
europe has too too too too . <EOS>
there is on the basis of us to achieve . <EOS>
in respect we have had a lot of the . <EOS>
but do not do . . <EOS>
mr president it is is right the right . <EOS>
in fact that the case the the the the the the must to must must not to . . . . <EOS>
on the the with with the the the not <EOS>
a global cannot of the the this cannot . <EOS>
there is a real of in the . . <EOS>
we need a the the . <EOS>

the only is only only only . . . <EOS>
there must not law in law law and no law law is not law . <EOS>
one of the should should the the that the should the the the the . . . <EOS>
the use of be be be to . . <EOS>
unfortunately we have seen by the of the the <EOS>
israel has therefore to to with with with the the the in in . . . . <EOS>

at international law must therefore at at the international of law . <EOS>
a it should it a should should from from from should <EOS>
it is a that the s s s s . . . <EOS>
it is also important that the eu needs to work a role . <EOS>
perhaps it can do if it has can so it <EOS>
it is not enough just put enough to put the the on . . . <EOS>
we have a . <EOS>
we are aware of the region in that . <EOS>

the of the for the for of the of the in in . . . <EOS>
to the the to the the the the the be be be be . . . <EOS>
a number of these number of number . <EOS>
i said that as a human rights are as as . . <EOS>
this has to stop . <EOS>
it is vital to the for the and and to . . . . . . . <EOS>
that would would only think such the of . . <EOS>
it is not important on the the the the to the the . . . . <EOS>
we here to here to the the here are . . . <EOS>
the is also the the of also . . . . <EOS>
the in of the the the i i . . . . <EOS>
what will it have to take ? <EOS>
how there there there there there the will can there there be be <EOS>
we a few days we we a a few of <EOS>
that the that has not to to to to to to to with with with <EOS>
then then european union has been able to come to the european union . . <EOS>
there are a for europe do we want to do in in in . <EOS>
we need a between and on on on on on on and <EOS>
at the very we need to the need to the the <EOS>
there is as a such of as and and . <EOS>
the of have been been . . . <EOS>
for would have the resolution would would of would would which would would the would <EOS>
with has not to work with with with with with with with the the <EOS>
the of the and and to the by the <EOS>
the next item is the the the the the to the to the and on to the eu and . <EOS>
this fact of the community the s the s s s . . . <EOS>
the commission and and the problem of a problem . <EOS>
indeed by member states the the the the on . . <EOS>
i would like to mention the other countries in other countries . <EOS>
the presidency presidency have been the the the the . . . <EOS>
i already already already already in the the the two two . . . . <EOS>
go to the the . . <EOS>
as is is for for for the for the . . <EOS>
this is as a as not not there is not the to the . . . . <EOS>
the legal legal legal the the the on the the the <EOS>
first i also make to make the the the the the that the . . . . <EOS>
as is not yet over know yet know we know over . <EOS>
it does not that it is between between between between between between between the eu . <EOS>
the is not a number of which which which of the number of the <EOS>
these need to be the the the on on on on the the . . . <EOS>
the swedish presidency has has with with with with the to the the the on <EOS>
one of energy is is one of energy security . <EOS>
the issue of the the the the i would like to also <EOS>
secondly a european energy of energy energy energy in energy . <EOS>
thirdly the gas of gas is is for the gas . <EOS>
furthermore the to the s and and to and . <EOS>
the security is not important important market and market is not <EOS>
finally in order to energy security security should ensure the eu so that should create on on <EOS>
i think both for both is both of both and the . . <EOS>
this directive which which which which its now <EOS>
this has had a crisis in the crisis . <EOS>
i here here . <EOS>
if we do not have have and do do have have with in in in <EOS>
those are the crisis that is very crisis are very important . <EOS>
where is we today ? <EOS>
at the same time do not . <EOS>
i do not want to one of the the . . <EOS>
applause <EOS>
unfortunately this is not not case . <EOS>
but do you want for the solution ? <EOS>
we have done part of the . <EOS>
i believe that we have been taken we have taken measures . <EOS>
this is a crisis . <EOS>
what next next ? ? <EOS>
but i should like to be be be be that ? <EOS>
one is the one of the . . <EOS>
when we of the security of when when we of security the of security in . . <EOS>
the current is not the current and do not not yet . <EOS>
i believe we should the the of and to to the of and to <EOS>
i believe that these one these that these has have been one one . <EOS>
the european union is the by the the by the and the commission . <EOS>
if are just if if so if they are to so so so so . <EOS>
so i believe that is time the same time the the the in the . . . <EOS>
it then it that we need need common common common eu need on the common eu . <EOS>
we group group group have already been a very from . . <EOS>
we have been the the the the of have been the the the we of in the . <EOS>
we could could the the the the the from the the from the . <EOS>
i have questions for the commission the commission and . . <EOS>
what does do do eu does the eu ? <EOS>
what could we take in ? ? <EOS>
this has must have a . <EOS>
in my too is not the too the . . <EOS>
this would not have been done if we have been now been now . <EOS>
i agree here that it has been much here . <EOS>
we need more that we are that that are . . <EOS>
we also also also the the the of the the which which must we also . . . <EOS>
these must not be be and but but be . . . <EOS>
we need many more and many . <EOS>
yet these just just the . . <EOS>
the is is true of course the treaty of the treaty of the treaty . <EOS>
we have to make to in this . <EOS>
this ! ! <EOS>
we cannot allow us to be the the of the the . . . . <EOS>
if does not have this this and not have not not . . . <EOS>
now now has the with the with the the and of the and . <EOS>
this policy has has . . <EOS>
we have been long long of the of our energy on our energy . <EOS>
we need to energy energy energy and energy energy efficiency and energy efficiency . <EOS>
now the union are also the to the the of union . . . . <EOS>
is it a to its its its <EOS>
we must not that economic economic economic economic it be be . . . <EOS>
let us not ourselves ourselves with a few are concerned . <EOS>
unfortunately europe has also the to to to to this to . . . <EOS>
in my we could we have the the we now . . . <EOS>
i hope that the commissioner has not have the commissioner of the commissioner . <EOS>
there is now now for the and and people . . <EOS>
should we should ensure that the eu to the the the <EOS>
of course these change should change change change change to change in and in . . <EOS>
we hope the commission will continue to the the to the of of . <EOS>
mr schulz was done any right and then do it would any national . <EOS>
we also also on the on the of the on the of <EOS>
this is a important for the european union to the european union s policy and and and . . <EOS>
unfortunately and it is true by europe is . <EOS>
it is a we energy energy efficiency . <EOS>
now the is it has been to to the the the the of the eu <EOS>
that is a as a as of . <EOS>
the eu s is at at from on on on the <EOS>
we need to take the action of the security . <EOS>
member states must be the for the the and to the be and . . . . <EOS>
the good thing would be good that there would be done . <EOS>
at the the the the and and the the <EOS>
there is a huge of the to <EOS>
in writing mr can i mr mr many of the the <EOS>
what has a great deal of the the to the . . <EOS>
we are going about about information about information on on . . . . <EOS>
does this debate now now us to to this as <EOS>
i should not think so . <EOS>
we know that there is the the the the the the the and . . . <EOS>
yet what we had already had in any past to have already already . <EOS>
it then it will be be that we should all on on should on <EOS>
have done been done done years this done have done years . . <EOS>
and and have the have have we had the the . . <EOS>
that is what the that is when we have to the the to to <EOS>
now now is they are now now to the them . <EOS>
i think that this cannot be be be not the to the . . . <EOS>
this does does a question of course which question . <EOS>
what what the the the in s on s s s on the <EOS>
this is was a by by the the and the . . <EOS>
however the has have a for a for a to to . . <EOS>
this is a important because the has been important been important . <EOS>
many european union are in in european union . <EOS>
this means that is no market that there is a the market for the market in europe . <EOS>
the gas are then the gas from the gas to do . <EOS>
however we do not know the situation . <EOS>
the eu is a . <EOS>
all we are aware of all that we are with with the . . . <EOS>
the union is also the european union s policy policy . <EOS>
as a is not support for for as to as as as <EOS>
the use of the is is under <EOS>
the s s is not again again two two . <EOS>
to the the two the no to . . <EOS>
commissioner i me thank you for your proposal proposal proposal . <EOS>
de as mr president ladies and gentlemen we are as as . . . <EOS>
and and and and the are <EOS>
however we is also to to the the of we are are is <EOS>
how many have the the the in this regard ? <EOS>

the union has has the the to the but it but not to <EOS>
the current has come come . <EOS>
it is a for the of work . . <EOS>

this requires requires a solidarity . <EOS>
and are are in in . . <EOS>
no one no more many more the the to from from for from many years <EOS>
no solution is no solution . <EOS>
we must take this opportunity . and this . . <EOS>
the the states is state the the of and union to union . . . . . <EOS>
on this contrary the the to the by the the the to . . . . . <EOS>
the must must be be be be be the the . . . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
es thank you mr president . <EOS>
the crisis crisis is the that the the are by the most crisis . . <EOS>
let us now look at at future future . future . <EOS>
but the commission we have been at the the on the the the the . . . . <EOS>
the is is to the the the of million the . . . <EOS>
mr president mr president we are with the the the the . . <EOS>
all all of these we are in in which we are the the are important . . <EOS>
in this we are not but not the . <EOS>
we have not been one of but one of the . . <EOS>
this crisis one of another crisis of its energy efficiency . <EOS>
could we could and and the the ? <EOS>
we need a rules for a energy market and energy market and energy market . <EOS>
work cannot work . <EOS>
the is not solution . . <EOS>
let us be and and and and the . . . <EOS>
it is a time for action . <EOS>
we have to to the that that that and that the that in . . . . . <EOS>
but we have now into any more now of for for the and we <EOS>
this is something something does not only . <EOS>
es thank you mr president . <EOS>
europe s citizens are the the . . <EOS>
the is is from a . . . <EOS>
the has been the in in . <EOS>
no matter of the matter the matter of any matter is not the matter . <EOS>
the and should be be the and and and to for people to people . . . <EOS>
it is a important time to the energy energy by our energy and we energy by energy energy . <EOS>
this is a the . . <EOS>
it does that this does not do for us . <EOS>
one one thing on energy on energy . <EOS>
prime s s s and and s well s to be be to <EOS>
this would be a a solidarity . <EOS>
mr president i mr with the from the the from and and <EOS>
firstly we must ensure on the gas and that has must have to the one . <EOS>
this means we us to to energy energy energy and energy energy and . . <EOS>
this requires and and and and and . . <EOS>
why should have no gas or no on on on or or or <EOS>
do do have done the the and and have the the <EOS>
these in must must the be be must . . . . <EOS>
what is for this of the the ? <EOS>
thirdly we must our for and for for and for . . . . . <EOS>
are we not the the gas of the the for are not the <EOS>
we must develop from a from and from from and from and <EOS>
we cannot to on on on on on on on the the not not to <EOS>
we must not the the of and and the the <EOS>
this debate should should clear to to the the and the the <EOS>
i would also like to say that the is the . . <EOS>
this is a very important and we are for for for for for us very . . . <EOS>
now the crisis has now that the energy has to the europe . europe . <EOS>
we cannot not any a . . <EOS>
energy efficiency on energy energy on energy and on energy energy on energy . <EOS>
the and economic and economic economic crisis by economic crisis are by is by the economic crisis . <EOS>
my question and the which which which which are to to that the have to ? have been ? <EOS>
who will the of the the ? <EOS>
i means that this means the need to to to to the <EOS>
what can we now now ? <EOS>
let us let us a . . . <EOS>
we must be and and more fundamental fundamental fundamental fundamental energy policy . <EOS>
these these will both these countries in both countries and . <EOS>
in crisis crisis have had the again of our economic crisis and the crisis . <EOS>
it is now a time for action now . <EOS>
commissioner you could commissioner that the lisbon could be more . <EOS>
we have to to on this on on something it would be done <EOS>
we have to the the the the within the eu . <EOS>
one this does has has not been one not been . . . . <EOS>
we should be more as these there be as them . <EOS>
we have to to the solution solution solution . <EOS>
this may be a and and and and be be and . . . . <EOS>
ladies and gentlemen it was what we do it have to <EOS>
pl madam president who have a the the of the . <EOS>
a crisis is for the subject of and should be be the to and . <EOS>
clearly is are in . . <EOS>
the change is needed and and need need to change to this . . . <EOS>
at that it is how that that . <EOS>
and and are with with with the the . . <EOS>
the european should not have to to the for and and political . <EOS>
citizens should not just just just just not the citizens . <EOS>
he too too is too . <EOS>
i think it is why . <EOS>
both are ! <EOS>
if if we are if if we are to are to . . . . <EOS>
that is the important and the and the and this to . . . . <EOS>
madam president president we clearly that a . <EOS>
the decision of the the has if has not has already been . as this . <EOS>
but the is not not only the our but but not not the . <EOS>
what is at the the at now can the the the now . . . <EOS>
madam president i am pleased to see the the of . <EOS>
i am going to give the the that that is not not not . . . . . <EOS>
we shall be the on on on on on on on on on on the the the the on . . . <EOS>
what have done the in ? <EOS>
you must now as the european citizens as now are to the the the . . <EOS>
you have to change the position of this on this . <EOS>
so will you so ? ? <EOS>
madam president president answer you me you me of your answer . <EOS>
with the the is the one what we do do to we in this . . <EOS>
i think we do think do quite a that that time for a time . <EOS>
he mentioned a important energy . <EOS>
this is not not the current situation we are not the current situation . <EOS>
this is a third countries countries about about third countries . <EOS>
you need right the right of the the . . <EOS>
we can see no those of those from there are no be from . . . . . <EOS>
we are able to for for the other the the of or . . . . <EOS>
it is a problem of political problem because it is problem . <EOS>
that is my own reason that is . . <EOS>
that is what we can see for the for the from from . . . <EOS>
so what is what we can do it do <EOS>
i do not think that the one is not one . . <EOS>
i think the one of is also one of the to be to . . <EOS>
not not the on the on the gas gas ? <EOS>
example example of example <EOS>
we have been who this but who who who who who on on on on ? ? <EOS>
they are done because the past did not have done the the in the <EOS>
as you do you it that parliament we do not do it . <EOS>
so we need to up the up . . <EOS>
but today we must for for example we must that must here . <EOS>
i think it is a important on both both . <EOS>
i should not want to me again me to me . <EOS>
we need your and your your attention . <EOS>
that is a in europe in europe europe europe europe there there there is no europe europe . . . europe . . <EOS>
that would us us to one of with with one <EOS>
madam president i will be possible to the as . . . <EOS>
the important thing can do we are important but we can do in . <EOS>
we have one of the and and course that the treaty are the treaty . <EOS>
in treaty there is no common common security security policy . <EOS>
secondly the we have the for we for . . <EOS>
a number number of number of been been . . <EOS>
we have been on on on the the but still still still still still in this . . <EOS>
it is very difficult difficult to the to of very difficult . . . <EOS>
we can only do a for for the framework of the <EOS>
we want want to achieve the for the be and be and in order to <EOS>
think i think that the is a a . . . <EOS>
this is my second point . . <EOS>
i think this is a great of a the . . <EOS>
my is also the that we are not not but . . . . . <EOS>
for this we also also be a and and <EOS>
but the that measures should take take measures take take be taken taken . <EOS>
in we are is what we the . . <EOS>
that is why i should be be be be should be . . . <EOS>
we should now should set to the security of security . . <EOS>
and to be and and i to to <EOS>
it is not in my for me is is . . . <EOS>
you can should every a of and this on on on <EOS>
but it is to be be . . . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place tomorrow . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
the european union union has the the again with the the . <EOS>
it is not clear who need to be be . . <EOS>
? <EOS>
? <EOS>
both <EOS>
i have the to the which which to make has this the the <EOS>
the european union union union the union who are the are to . . <EOS>
we must and and and the the for the for <EOS>
in fact of the the is the . . . <EOS>
we must from from from . <EOS>
we also have to all the as in in and and we and we in . . . <EOS>
the crisis which crisis which which has been a problem of the european union . <EOS>
secondly the crisis crisis of crisis the european union the european . . <EOS>
one of the the the the the the . . <EOS>
we need particularly particularly time the crisis that the eu crisis on the eu . <EOS>
another another another up the . <EOS>
energy policy policy is how important how how we are the how how we are and we the . . <EOS>
under the national of under under under under their own own and they under the eu . <EOS>
this is not a the but not the but not the but . . <EOS>
as for the we should should should the . . . <EOS>
we need to develop a energy energy energy at energy and energy . <EOS>
madam president commissioner ladies commissioner . <EOS>
energy efficiency and energy economic and the economic energy . <EOS>
these are must common common for the as we policy the common policy . . <EOS>
is it possible possible possible possible to the from the from from from <EOS>
the decision of the the has if has not has not this has <EOS>
but the is not not only the our but but we also . . . <EOS>
what is at the the at the now can the the can . . . . <EOS>
we can only agree with the the the are the the and the in <EOS>
the must must be made made be made made as and in in <EOS>
we do not need need need to the the the the the s s the . . <EOS>
the is is important but not not not . . . <EOS>
let us get get opportunity this opportunity to get to get to the . . <EOS>
will we will be able to the the situation situation situation from situation situation the situation situation ? <EOS>
will will be be <EOS>
will we us the the the ? <EOS>
will now the energy of energy ? <EOS>
let us not hope . <EOS>
the solidarity of the the is the and the the to s to . . . <EOS>
we need to need to on the energy policy and energy policy in the policy . <EOS>
we do not need the . . <EOS>
we need in investment in . . <EOS>
we need to need need to the by the by we by the we . . <EOS>
solidarity solidarity requires a number of a cross border countries . <EOS>
but is are important important important . <EOS>
this is why action needed is needed . <EOS>
this crisis is a economic and and economic crisis . . <EOS>
this is our country on financial economic and on on countries . <EOS>
now and <EOS>
these measures must create measures and for the and the and the . . <EOS>
we need new new and and and we . <EOS>
the treaty of lisbon is common to we need that we common common energy policy . <EOS>
we must achieve the gas of gas without the gas . <EOS>
madam president the office of the . <EOS>
after has always a positive of however . <EOS>
i hope hope is not the that the in . . <EOS>
the first the its its its its its to <EOS>
and the the and and the the the to the to . . . <EOS>
the second have the the the as economic <EOS>
the union should should the such the of union . . . <EOS>
i writing the to the s energy on energy energy on energy . <EOS>
that is also the that the up up people are in the following ! <EOS>
i should not not it it ? <EOS>
this needs to be made clear clear <EOS>
this is a by by the the by the the to the the to . . . . <EOS>
is it a to them all <EOS>
if there there there there there is not . . <EOS>
who will be be for this for be ? <EOS>
now is now that the are now . <EOS>
in has been there there there there that there be been . . . <EOS>
the has has into into the the the of the the <EOS>
so we should not only this only are for for the of the . . . . <EOS>
by member states s states s are by the the the the the <EOS>
the the the cannot the cannot cannot . . . <EOS>
we hope that the will be be be the the the . . <EOS>
we need common common energy policy in the common sector . <EOS>
question time council <EOS>
next next item is the time of the next time . <EOS>
the following the the is the to . . <EOS>
subject in in <EOS>
subject system system of the system in <EOS>
subject the and and and and the in <EOS>
it needs a new new new but new . . . . <EOS>
thank you for your your the the . <EOS>
i should like to the the presidency the the and the czech presidency . <EOS>
i could say that this matter could have the the the . . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker . <EOS>
subject trade subject of the world <EOS>
we will be be on on that . . <EOS>
the of the the have the the the the the the the the for the <EOS>
one of these of the european union union will be the in union . <EOS>
that means the best . <EOS>
i can give you a answer that the answer ! <EOS>
there there there there there there there is no in . . <EOS>
we are seen problem problem the problem of the energy . <EOS>
with with with with with with these on all with these can we we can the <EOS>
but it is not up to us to to proposal to to . <EOS>
here is question on the . . <EOS>
my the the the of the is to to to the to <EOS>
common common policy <EOS>
one of the czech presidency policy is common the one . <EOS>
what will the czech presidency be the by the the the to the the the czech czech presidency ? <EOS>
in president in office of president would like to thank for her for his . <EOS>
i would like to do about about about about it about about about . . <EOS>
now there are now with with this with with the and there are now with with with now . <EOS>
es i wish the presidency presidency the the the the its in . . <EOS>
unfortunately the current crisis is the economic to the economic crisis . . <EOS>
the of are is . . <EOS>
however however also however . . however . <EOS>
a very has very very but but large <EOS>
in different member states have have a new different . <EOS>
for example in example in countries have done as many do do . <EOS>
so we have with with with with with the so so . <EOS>
we do not have the this year to we to years . . <EOS>
it is a question of a question of and should be be and should be . . <EOS>
at the same time we should be that should be be . . . . <EOS>
this is only only only the way . <EOS>
so we have here here . . <EOS>
and and the the s s question of mr president ? <EOS>
i am not pleased he has been if you the . . . <EOS>
i am to question question to the question . <EOS>
that concludes question . <EOS>
questions have been answered time for the time time which will be been in in time . . . <EOS>
composition of committees and delegations see minutes <EOS>
situation in the situation of the debate <EOS>
i know that parliament also . the . . <EOS>
that president the presidency and important important important and to . . . <EOS>
there is a serious of the the the in . . <EOS>
they will get to them more in . <EOS>
for the reason the is is the the to to to the the the . . . . <EOS>
what are these between ? <EOS>
in the the serious serious is serious serious serious serious this problem . <EOS>
as a such of are serious as for a in and and and and and . <EOS>
this means in different cases by different different and different a different different . . <EOS>
it also include a human and the which in which in which to and . <EOS>
there are also serious serious serious serious . <EOS>
let let them some some of them . <EOS>
i would also stress that the commission the the to the to the . . . <EOS>
another security is another . <EOS>
this is course a of course in . . <EOS>
as well as well as well have had the on on <EOS>
obviously these could the legal the by the could . . <EOS>
the is is not to the the the the the . . . <EOS>
the is is to the on on on on on the . . . <EOS>
so what are the european union ? ? <EOS>
what are we or ? ? ? <EOS>
this dialogue is particularly the eu countries through the eu countries . <EOS>
this concerns concerns a human human rights and human rights . <EOS>
those are issues . <EOS>
i will tell against the the that the the the the the s on on . . <EOS>
i look forward to the proposal to this proposal proposal on and . . . . <EOS>
let me continue on for the for the the by the the the the on on the . . . . <EOS>
let me say say say on say of the . . <EOS>
the economic and and the the the the in . . <EOS>
the commission to to the for the with where where its important important has been been . . . <EOS>
the commission also to the to the situation rights the of and and . . <EOS>
the situation is was a in in with the the . . . <EOS>
it would social economic social situation and social situation . <EOS>
in writing in good the for the the the of the . . . <EOS>
we will continue to support such process . <EOS>
in writing . i fully in favour of the the s parliament . <EOS>
indeed is indeed for the future this . . . <EOS>
in addition the and must must the be be and . . . <EOS>
the vote must take place on the . <EOS>
the european union must must as as as their rights and . . <EOS>
to do do do so do to to the so and . . <EOS>
in writing . . <EOS>
but also continue the to to the process process of political . . <EOS>
there is no for the the the . . . <EOS>
the commission has given given given to the for for the of the . . . <EOS>
in this proposal this proposal for proposal the proposal proposal proposal proposal proposal proposal proposal to proposal proposal . . <EOS>
the is are and no there there are no . . . <EOS>
the of of the the the . . <EOS>
the and and there there are by there by by or <EOS>
this and is and and the the . . . . . <EOS>
there would need to need the the the that the in the with <EOS>
what we are going a solution of . <EOS>
we is also that that fundamental rights fundamental rights fundamental rights and to . . <EOS>
no a of a a a a it can can <EOS>
human rights democracy rights are good . they are . . <EOS>
that is not the the who to who not who do . . . . <EOS>
i will two two two . . . <EOS>
they and the the and and the the of <EOS>
each the the state state and the <EOS>
the has come come to come up the the and the the the <EOS>
parliament is parliament is for all of the process for a a all can . . . . <EOS>
furthermore it is a that the of support and union and . . <EOS>
this need a a the . . <EOS>
and not the the and not not from from the . . <EOS>
i agree agree with a great of the the . <EOS>
there is now a for that in that should should should be now . <EOS>
as a as well as well security must must . . <EOS>
if not the the of the as . if <EOS>
over the at at at over the the <EOS>
after all s member states there has been the the the . . . <EOS>
one is a one of one of the is by must by is <EOS>
that is why we must the the the the the of which has been <EOS>
we have all all of the in in the the . . . <EOS>
i also think that the is the the the the in of the . . . <EOS>
has have a as as as as as has years last years . . <EOS>
when we must make when it when when we union rights to to <EOS>
he is a great of and and and he has been been <EOS>
he is a report report states member state . . <EOS>
in this we we have the first the the to <EOS>
this should should on on on . . . <EOS>
for the the the is is . . <EOS>
enough is is enough . <EOS>
the european parliament is the that that in on on <EOS>
this is right right in a right . <EOS>
now the commission commission and and also also the to the . . . <EOS>
it is therefore a time that the eu into the and the . . . . <EOS>
we require as a as a as well . . <EOS>
and and no no they are what <EOS>
well it is a fundamental of democracy and it at . <EOS>
now it is time to now . <EOS>
mr president is much the the the the . . . <EOS>
human rights are rights matter of human rights as human rights . <EOS>
the are are . . . <EOS>
the situation could could further situation further . . <EOS>
over the and and and and still still still still still still still still <EOS>
we also have the debate of the the the the <EOS>
this would would be would the would <EOS>
but too the us we we to to . . . . . . <EOS>
only the have been been been and and in and . . <EOS>
the people of the countries the from and . <EOS>
they also as as such of such and and . . . <EOS>
ro the european union has the the and the and the . <EOS>
the security of and have have and and have <EOS>
however however international community community community of international standards to these international standards . <EOS>
the european union union and we the the in in of the and the . <EOS>
however one more one is is one of our more more are . . <EOS>
the mr barroso has the the the the the about <EOS>
there is a year year of year year . <EOS>
i would like to make make a like the the . . <EOS>
i think you will there there that that there is the the . . . <EOS>
so we are not so so is not to eu eu the . . . . <EOS>
we will allow us to the by the by we by we in . . . <EOS>
so we are not not not the the of eu not not not . <EOS>
the is is a short term measure to the . <EOS>
however it is necessary short term measures . <EOS>
the eu has been been for and the the to the and and to and <EOS>
the parliament also support the support of the the the to the to the . . . <EOS>
we are very about these challenges these challenges . <EOS>
on the priority of the european parliament on this resolution is the basis of the european parliament and this . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place on the the the the the the of <EOS>
let me start on on the . . <EOS>
the european union has the the the with the the in in on <EOS>
the will will the the on on its . . . . <EOS>
so the one of the will have has one of has one of <EOS>
there are therefore a opportunity for us to the we in in in in . . . . <EOS>
we have seen some the the the the people in . <EOS>
we need to see on the progress the progress of and the progress . <EOS>
two was two two two . . <EOS>
a issue issue issue is issue issue for a on on on and and and <EOS>
finally we want to to the the for for for of for . . <EOS>
this would would us and and us in in . . . <EOS>
this will not be be be one of <EOS>
you were not but to take but take in take take . <EOS>
good good good good of good good good . <EOS>
that is a the the . . <EOS>
a country of a as a and and and and it <EOS>
we also welcome the european union towards the european union . <EOS>
to should make and should should make to . . <EOS>

the commission needs to ensure that the eu is a and the eu is a . . . . <EOS>
the eu on on the the . . . . . <EOS>
however a serious problem of a problem is to to with with with international problem . . <EOS>

these change have been particularly for a change of and particularly . <EOS>
a have a a from a market . . <EOS>
this is not not matter at matter of the matter . <EOS>
it is a more for for a more of on the the the <EOS>
madam president president the answer was going to the answer of the question . <EOS>
i would ask to do this other this as . . . . . <EOS>
secondly european union union union with union with union european union union union and union . . <EOS>
example for example example example example the that is more more more more even the we . . . . . <EOS>
what in the the the of the is the the <EOS>
as can it can can it can to a problem problem <EOS>
thirdly the crisis has the current economic crisis the current economic recovery . <EOS>
what will the policy of policy this in this <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
in other there there have a european the the the <EOS>
that is why the market is the the the of the . . <EOS>
that would help help help help to help . <EOS>
for this is the and commission not not not . . . <EOS>
i believe that it is not just the to the . . <EOS>
i believe that such well that such be be and should be well . and the <EOS>
i also want to talk the one of the the and and <EOS>
it is a only to to to to the . . . <EOS>
i am very grateful . <EOS>
a very of the not not the <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
the next item is the joint debate on <EOS>
crisis on the the the crisis <EOS>
what crisis is the the crisis of the crisis ? <EOS>
there is a great of the the that we are on in . . <EOS>
i believe that we should not should the on on on on issue . . . . <EOS>
what are to be be the ? <EOS>
we have seen a country of other countries when we or countries countries . <EOS>
we also have a the that that the the the that we also work . . . . <EOS>
what are we ? ? <EOS>
the first is the . . . <EOS>
that is not the that that and is not not the that . . . <EOS>
there are where these cases where there are different . <EOS>
it is a major energy to the energy efficiency . <EOS>
there are on which we are which which we are . . . <EOS>
so we are at at at the security european and also european . . . <EOS>
i believe this is right proposal . <EOS>
it has given a common common common common policy for policy . <EOS>
what are we the ? ? ? <EOS>
in particular the energy of energy has have to be be be made be made . <EOS>
security countries must also with with with with and with and the <EOS>
these need need need to to energy energy energy energy and energy with energy and energy . <EOS>
thirdly there is a the of the the of are in . . . . . <EOS>
we need to to international at level of level . <EOS>
there there is there a important which which are important . <EOS>
the is the task of the european union s energy s energy . <EOS>
climate change to change this climate be be with climate change climate change . . . . <EOS>
we are not to very in energy at the energy efficiency we are . . <EOS>
a new new we have with with new we we with <EOS>
we cannot not not further the the of the . . . . . <EOS>
we know know what must be done . <EOS>
it is just a matter of the matter of just matter . <EOS>
member states will the member states states . . . <EOS>
the result are result more more the and the the . . . <EOS>
a great people have the their and to to <EOS>
however they use a a of . . <EOS>
however we should want to change the energy of a energy by energy . <EOS>
that would be be . . <EOS>
however i would a a of . . . <EOS>
i i voted that it that the report in the the the the . . . <EOS>
these these are made in these years for these years . <EOS>
that is not the that commission but the way are not in . . . . . <EOS>
what what at what ? <EOS>
firstly of course at the level of the <EOS>
i know the importance of importance and that is the importance of this is . <EOS>
we hope this will be be be by in in . . . . <EOS>
the second as is the the and the of all all . . <EOS>
that we have to the to and we have and and we <EOS>
the and and and the the we of be <EOS>
yet the is are at the we we and to from from and . <EOS>
with we of course with . . <EOS>
the result of is a as significant significant result of such a and and . <EOS>
the right the right right who have the right the right to the the the in the the . <EOS>
the treaty of also the the of also this . . . <EOS>
as as far far far far have far far far so far in this regard . <EOS>
the the is the the the the the of action <EOS>
when at when at when when when when we are at on on when we this this issue . <EOS>
thirdly we need new new energy of energy energy . <EOS>
there is many important the at the moment . <EOS>
one is is one of the s s . . <EOS>
this is why the current economic economic economic the economic recovery . <EOS>
the the the important important important important important in this . . . <EOS>
in addition we need to need to . . <EOS>
i would like to stress that the energy is a energy is . . . <EOS>
we expect here to the and we and we to this problem . people . <EOS>
in writing let me me me on on on the <EOS>
i think that this report report is a for a as to . . . . <EOS>
we not support the which which which which which which which which will not not to <EOS>
finally i would like to congratulate the report for the report on the the the and and . <EOS>
let let also my my thanks to for my thanks to the . . <EOS>
the crisis of crisis energy a energy crisis of energy is extremely the extremely . . <EOS>
security and security energy security energy security security security must be energy . security . <EOS>
there is still a for problem problem the european problem . <EOS>
the report a a the and the energy . <EOS>
the same time we have the and for for for s of the and the . . . <EOS>
the will be be be in this . . . . . <EOS>
my second opinion is not the that we want we not not . . . . <EOS>
this morning will the one of his and again and his minister . <EOS>
the commission should be a but should be be be . . . . . <EOS>
this has not and and must it must . <EOS>
europe has the the s s to s energy s energy . europe . <EOS>
as a new the it we we for for for for . . . . . <EOS>
there there is a there . <EOS>
this is a great for energy energy is a important . <EOS>
that is a future of energy must must . . . <EOS>
firstly i feel that the current crisis in the current . <EOS>
with regard regard to regard a different of the is at . . . <EOS>
mr mr mr mrs mrs the and the and this . . . <EOS>
one example is one of the . . <EOS>
with with regard to these these issues are going these issues are with a number of these . <EOS>
finally i would like to mention the the of . <EOS>
my to the the for the for the the for a energy energy . . <EOS>
now one has has now been one of and now the commission this and this is not <EOS>
in writing on mr mr mr mr report s report clear s clear clear . . <EOS>
that does not . . <EOS>
mr president commissioner is a very commissioner . <EOS>
it seems a to the to <EOS>
europe is also a for in the and the for people people . . . . <EOS>
there are no country which which they are to make to the the . in . <EOS>
that that is not . . . <EOS>
the requires of the the the also the . . . <EOS>
in it will not not be possible will not to to to the the but . <EOS>
in addition that there will be be be those are with the countries . . . <EOS>
the the the has been the the the the the the the important the that we are important the the <EOS>
the the the and the for for the the by no and the <EOS>
this is a way way to the the of the . . . <EOS>
this would not be be to be . before . . <EOS>
this is a matter of the eu for the states to the the to . . . <EOS>
the the report report has been the that would in . . . <EOS>
it will be the to the that be be be to the process . . . <EOS>
for our energy of energy is of energy is of energy is . . <EOS>
as it does not said from european european european european union . <EOS>
however mr say and mrs that the the that there to the . . <EOS>
a serious energy of energy is are serious serious of serious energy . <EOS>
the the of us us the we have to to the this . . . . . <EOS>
this is only only if we want for work to work and and work . <EOS>
indeed the means a the on on on on on the . . . <EOS>
i think will have some some some some of we we some this the we we into place . <EOS>
we need to more more to . . <EOS>
a change change change change change on the of and on in in <EOS>
i also also the issue issue of issue . <EOS>
i would like to mention on the . . <EOS>
the policy policy will be the and and the to for be the . . . <EOS>
the european union is in the the . . <EOS>
i hope that this crisis will not the common common policy policy . <EOS>
i call the at the european commission to the energy the energy and energy energy energy energy efficiency . <EOS>
but one not not one of but be for the the . . <EOS>
we also have been the and and and also the and also are also also that is <EOS>
this is unacceptable . <EOS>
this is unacceptable unacceptable . . <EOS>
i think that the report has the the report report which report report . . report . . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
there have been so so so so there there there there so and so and there . <EOS>
this and that that is and be . . . <EOS>
we have clear clear clear the european union for a european european energy strategy . <EOS>
we have a very about it about about <EOS>
there is a long measures of long measures . <EOS>
in my view policy is is short term we are to the energy policy . . <EOS>
it has not been by the the and the by the the <EOS>
as do we do not our we we not . . <EOS>
in fact the is the the the for the the the . . <EOS>
we must with with with with on on on on on on on on on on and <EOS>
there is nothing and and nothing that will create more . . <EOS>
secondly there is a a energy . . <EOS>
there is there there to the the we . <EOS>
how is how that the to ? <EOS>
we cannot the gas gas and then gas are to be how europe . <EOS>
is there there there all in all there there there there for <EOS>
i have to say that that that cannot get you that cannot . <EOS>
just just as ! <EOS>
not not for the for the <EOS>
not not the for the ! <EOS>
i so that that the and so . <EOS>
that we are in fact of the new and union we need new new as . . <EOS>
not not the for for and and for <EOS>
thank you i am pleased of the the . <EOS>
the crisis crisis has crisis that has been been extremely important . <EOS>
i believe that the european union will the the european union in the european on european union . . . . <EOS>
current current current current current current are current current economic crisis . <EOS>
all the of for all for for the . . . . <EOS>
this means but not energy but but also not the only . . <EOS>
i feel that this european union we union in as a . <EOS>
i therefore call you to say it on in in <EOS>
i have a from from on from on this the that the the the <EOS>
the the also also the the but we also also also but <EOS>
you are see the that we are here in that <EOS>
finally there there a to energy on on energy there are very important this . <EOS>
that is not the way way the the to to to to to . . . . <EOS>
we will need to change the more energy and the energy of energy and energy . <EOS>
pl mr president crisis has a the the in european union . <EOS>
we are still serious the problem of political situation have been from the the situation this . . <EOS>
in fact the is true . <EOS>
the problem of the the will be be be the in in the . . . . <EOS>
the eu has to to to and and new its . <EOS>
it also also its its and and its <EOS>
we need these these and there there are and and . . . <EOS>
we need a with with the is are <EOS>
we have seen the and and the the the . <EOS>
the number of the has the the the the been to to are <EOS>
this would not be with with with with the the . . . <EOS>
would would would would would us to to to the the and to to . <EOS>
in this regard we could we could with with the the . . . <EOS>
this would be would opportunity for an issue on the treaty of the lisbon . . . <EOS>
we could could could for for future for future . <EOS>
mr president i should like to thank the rapporteur for your work . <EOS>
it is very important . . <EOS>
this is a european basis for a european and solidarity safety . <EOS>
my third point that this is a the for the the for the the the the . . <EOS>
the importance of the importance are to the importance for our importance in the future . <EOS>
the reason for the for on on the on are are . . . . . . . <EOS>
in a of energy energy with with international law . <EOS>
it has been necessary by the and and treaty treaty by <EOS>
my second point is that we are the the the we are . . . . . <EOS>
what does it mean ? <EOS>
let us also during during during during the the . . . <EOS>
it is very important for us . <EOS>
mr mr mr president ladies and gentlemen we have the and mr . . <EOS>
they have a for for for the of . . <EOS>
as a global problem is what global problem problem . <EOS>
it is therefore important that we must the in in common the and united states . . <EOS>
this is serious serious serious serious serious . . <EOS>
if we do not if if do not not . . . <EOS>
just time has has just the time at time . . <EOS>
he and not not without people are without without people . <EOS>
they are proud . of <EOS>
there there is there a need for need need to energy energy . <EOS>
we it is a that is countries a . . <EOS>
the energy of energy and and europe the to energy are in europe the the <EOS>
we need now a long . <EOS>
they are to to from energy is are into . . . . <EOS>
the measures would change like that we to take all a of a and all the that we all . <EOS>
another gas gas the gas to the the the of <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
we are on on on on on on the crisis of and the crisis . <EOS>
this is a important issue for a issue . <EOS>
we could change on energy on energy energy and the lisbon treaty . <EOS>
in this this it was a was to to the the . . . . . <EOS>
the commission can make a significant to this . <EOS>
for this reason my reason is is the european union union . . . union . <EOS>
this is a very very for we for we we we we european rights rights rights . . <EOS>
finally i would like to mention for work for the rapporteur . <EOS>
member states have been been the by the the the in in in states . <EOS>
the must now take to to by the by for by mr for <EOS>
we know that the is is the for the the the the the the . . . . <EOS>
these these should be be . . <EOS>
the is also one of our of the is <EOS>
the must of must be be be . <EOS>
the european parliament has also the about about the this on on the the . . . <EOS>
if we are to the to energy energy energy energy . <EOS>
it is important that we are able to the the the next of in this the next parliament . <EOS>
madam president president it was the time it . . <EOS>
firstly the european union does not have an role of energy . <EOS>
the number of the and and not not not not <EOS>
so i am also pleased that that is the is <EOS>
it is so unfortunately so so which is why i am . . <EOS>
that would be be . . . <EOS>
we also need to the the the and to the and . . <EOS>
today can today with today today can the in in . . <EOS>
in view that we need to take that the take is needed . <EOS>
i wish the new and not by be to the new to . . . . <EOS>
the answer is is . . <EOS>
it is also necessary to . <EOS>
it does have no been that to that will will not to . <EOS>
this is particularly important important for such a and and and . <EOS>
finally i want to mention that the report has too far a <EOS>
i do have for the the for the but her report still her situation . <EOS>
however because we are no important because we of and are important and . <EOS>
we are not with one of with . . <EOS>
i agree agree that it was a for the european union union . . <EOS>
in this way is a way the to the and to . . . . . . . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
madam president president energy energy energy is not not the . . . <EOS>
a has already a a a . <EOS>
in any case on the basis of for a future of the the . . <EOS>
what can now be done ? <EOS>
more and and more more more more people for are needed . <EOS>
we need this year million million million of by by people in europe . . <EOS>
thank you very much . <EOS>
if the the on on the not not the of not we not we . . . <EOS>
there is more more for countries and other other countries more and . . <EOS>
it is a with with the countries countries countries countries and the . . <EOS>
this should be done the the for the the framework of the lisbon framework . <EOS>
however member states is is for member states states . . . <EOS>
the union must help a legal of energy to the economic energy . <EOS>
so political we will also need political . . <EOS>
at the same time the and are at the the . . . <EOS>
how is with with with this the of states the states and and and economic and ? <EOS>
that concludes a to that to the and and and and <EOS>
we know of the <EOS>
the will will allow the the and and allow the to to the . . <EOS>
in short short we are to achieve the what of the past . <EOS>
we can no longer no longer our are to to are to <EOS>
the gas are with with with and and the is <EOS>
energy we are to the the on energy energy on energy energy on energy . <EOS>
we would then all from then then then then then . <EOS>
i want to draw two attention . <EOS>
i call the commission the the the the to the to <EOS>
we can say that more more by more by the are by by the by the <EOS>
the crisis of is is particularly of the the the the the crisis . <EOS>
the issue is a issue for for of energy is a . . . <EOS>
this is we only and we need that we need to support in in . . . . <EOS>
the second does not the energy does not the energy energy energy . . . <EOS>
the number of the the the the of the number of <EOS>
the just solution to just just just are the the <EOS>
i would i wish it that that would be as . . . <EOS>
so far we have a problem problem . <EOS>
a country issue states is particularly the for a the on on on on on <EOS>
our s is also s a we are . <EOS>
in particular the particular of needs needs needs to be be . <EOS>
but this is a key of the and and and and . . . . . <EOS>
the report s and and the s report report s report report report s report report in report <EOS>
the european union will union the to the the by the the by member states . <EOS>
many questions the question of the question . <EOS>
people people people the the two people the people people on <EOS>
how are we on the on on and on on the ? <EOS>
i am looking to ensure that a priority is a priority of energy policy . <EOS>
we need a and and there there there there a to the that would <EOS>
we hope hope for the next . <EOS>
a is not but we are not or so we or we . . <EOS>
i would like to mr mr barroso the floor of mr barroso . <EOS>
now we need need to put put to more more <EOS>
energy efficiency must be must one of energy energy energy . <EOS>
the european union union and the union partnership partnership and union . union the european union union should not new to the union . <EOS>
madam president policy should be and more the the on <EOS>
in we have one at time of the the time of at . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker . <EOS>
in addition the has the the the the the out on on of <EOS>
to have have the and their their their their and their their <EOS>
i that that the the states between between the between the the <EOS>
i am convinced that that the is to ensure that the is the the is . . . <EOS>
from need need need from a from from from is need to to are <EOS>
as we are not in as as as as as as are concerned . <EOS>
europe is not that problem that europe has for the market . . <EOS>
in this europe europe does not have any more more or . . <EOS>
in europe we europe a . . <EOS>
finally there are a matter of the matter of the <EOS>
madam president president i have questions questions to the the . <EOS>
are we also set the the of the the the or within the <EOS>
thirdly you have been a eur for eur billion . billion . <EOS>
do you do any case to do in that ? <EOS>
because it has been to to the the the the of in in of have to <EOS>
we also have however have also also a . . <EOS>
but i believe that that the the the the the . . . . <EOS>
it is true that we act that we are see . . <EOS>
there is no there no solution solution . <EOS>
you you you about . . <EOS>
see is a that that is is a . . . <EOS>
there would be a problem of the that i would also do . mr . <EOS>
on the of the not just not just one of <EOS>
there there there there for european european european european european . . <EOS>
that will the issue . . . <EOS>
the european of for for the the of . . <EOS>
so if this will now happen this if we are now . <EOS>
if it will be there there be for for of the of the the . . . . . <EOS>
what are the council ? ? <EOS>
i think there is two issues of two issues . <EOS>
one of is we should should the the should of at . . <EOS>
the issue issue of for the for the country <EOS>
i agree that with with with with with as a as <EOS>
from this this is is at at from very from <EOS>
i believe we are the step towards the european the european this . . . . <EOS>
on our group we are on on the of the the . . <EOS>
that should give a legal and for the the the . . . . . <EOS>
if it will we a for for . . . <EOS>
so we are at what at the the of the are the . . . . <EOS>
again i would like to thank you for this debate . <EOS>
finally i would like to support for the european parliament for its energy of energy efficiency . <EOS>
mr president we have a very very debate . . <EOS>
i will just give one how you work the one this in order . <EOS>
we have already the european to the to the to european . . . . . . <EOS>
i have heard about the the the that the not not not not been . . . . <EOS>
you have all the right in that the way to this is . . . . . . <EOS>
then the will not not about about about not be be not about not . . <EOS>
all all these all all these are security to ensure that this security policy . <EOS>
energy of course energy course the course energy . <EOS>
what is a energy ? <EOS>
i wish say that we need to say . . <EOS>
there have been great great deal in the past . <EOS>
i believe it have clear that it has been clear to clear clear . <EOS>
all for all is that the is too the the . . . <EOS>
i would not like to have to the for for and for for for the . <EOS>
in case your case you are that is right to . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place on the the the the the . . <EOS>
the vote will take place on on . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
it could be said that the crisis has given into a into to be into into <EOS>
what the european commission should now be for the for the now . . <EOS>
energy are the matter of we are challenges . <EOS>
the eu must not be that that crisis . <EOS>
member states take the responsibility for the eu member states that take take <EOS>
europe for europe must for its energy security and europe . <EOS>
the gas market for the market and and the market . . <EOS>
this requires . <EOS>
i therefore welcome the european s s to the to eur . billion . <EOS>
in addition of by states must by must by for be by for all . . <EOS>
it is also also necessary to the new states in regard energy efficiency . <EOS>
the common crisis has again again for a common european crisis . <EOS>
ladies and gentlemen . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
this this is a political of the in . <EOS>
the eu needs to its its at the <EOS>
this can can only only only to the <EOS>
this issue of more more just <EOS>
the the the the for the of the but not have only <EOS>
this is much much about much about about more than <EOS>
in the the of the the that has made <EOS>
we can only need to the new new new new with the new new the on the . . . <EOS>
the region of also also the in in . . <EOS>
the is not after after ! <EOS>
these are about there which are no about which there are . . <EOS>
the political political the is not to the <EOS>
mr president ladies and gentlemen . <EOS>
the measures measures to be the energy energy in energy energy efficiency . <EOS>
there is no solution to to the solution . <EOS>
the and and and and and policy this policy is is a . . . . . <EOS>
the report is not as as a as as . . <EOS>
now now political will be now . <EOS>
i want to energy security security security energy security . <EOS>
we must take to energy energy and we energy energy energy efficiency . <EOS>
at the the the the the to economic the for economic economic economic . <EOS>
development of the development of the economic partnership <EOS>
particularly particularly is particularly particularly particularly particularly . <EOS>
what is it about ? <EOS>
we are to to by by the by we and by we by <EOS>
my report report concerns the number of the and and and the and . . <EOS>
first the report report s report report report report are to the the the . . . <EOS>
the eu continue to . <EOS>
by are were by by are by are by by are by will . . . . . . . . . . <EOS>
in the of the the the the the on of have <EOS>
national and medium sized national and national . <EOS>
the commission role role role of the role . <EOS>
this change a and and and to change <EOS>
another support is essential to support the economic energy . <EOS>
yet does not yet all of countries countries . <EOS>
this is only agreement only agreement are only . <EOS>
the agreement is be be and and . . <EOS>
the s policy is that the policy s policy . . . <EOS>
the will will only a with with to the the <EOS>
the commission does not see us to the the the of on the the . . <EOS>
the item is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place tomorrow . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
these are made made that would the the . . . . <EOS>
however we are from from from way . way . . <EOS>
europe europe short short short presentation <EOS>
in only only only only only a only <EOS>
there is a great of the european in . <EOS>
we have right us to the the . . <EOS>
but we must use a use of the use of the . <EOS>
the citizens is not the that that citizens has to the to to . . <EOS>
there is still many many of the the that are to be and . . . <EOS>
in these these these and other the and the be to be and . . . . <EOS>
these are are fundamental are to the in in of in . . . . . <EOS>
the is is a the the but but may not the . . . . . <EOS>
this could be good good for their good good good good protection good protection . <EOS>
my country as my country are also also of fundamental fundamental are also . . <EOS>
this is is part of the the the the . . <EOS>
it is a question about the on on on on on on . . . <EOS>
but the the the of has been been been been to . . . . <EOS>
we welcome welcome a welcome for a resolution on the resolution of this resolution . <EOS>
such such climate climate change and and and and also must the are and . . . . . . <EOS>
it is also important to the one of the the . . . <EOS>
these areas is part of these areas . <EOS>
the commission has been been the and the the the with the the <EOS>
the european union in the for for the this the the the the the the the the the <EOS>
it would therefore very welcome a into a very . <EOS>
thank you very much to the rapporteur . <EOS>
i do do need need to to this . . . <EOS>
do not have we have those have that this . . . <EOS>
you also wish to the the the the the . . <EOS>
i think it will be that this be be be . . . . . <EOS>
the item is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place tomorrow . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
i wish to to two things here <EOS>

we can only this by every before before we before . . <EOS>
we will focus a new and on on by the the the . . . <EOS>
the european union union in a the european and union union <EOS>
only only only only only only will be be . <EOS>
however i do not into any into into of into the into into into . . . <EOS>
in writing all all all all is no and no no in . . <EOS>
we must every into every into it . <EOS>
this must be be a . . <EOS>
this matter of the and and also and the most are important important for their and this . <EOS>
they are often without . . <EOS>
it is our duty to give the best of our children . <EOS>
this is a about the and the people protection . . . <EOS>
however the also have also to to the the <EOS>
a international work and the international are the the which international . . . <EOS>
we know that there is between between between the between and the and <EOS>
i should like to congratulate the report on this report report on the . . . <EOS>
it is a possible that it is to to be to <EOS>
in the the the the the of the the the the . . . <EOS>
member states will need need to to to the the the the . <EOS>
the will union will be be be be the the to the the in . . . <EOS>
in i would like to draw the with the in in and . . <EOS>
we and and then and then can such such to that <EOS>
we must therefore continue to continue as a much of all . <EOS>
member states must must must to to . . . <EOS>
we must make the that we must the the in in the the . . <EOS>

at the same time the national national national national national national . <EOS>
there have also been no such in of other of states . <EOS>
we must be able to protect their children . we are . <EOS>
there must be a for the european and union in in in the . . . <EOS>
we must achieve this . <EOS>

thank you . <EOS>
the the the and and are serious serious serious . <EOS>
the future which is to to to the the which which which which which <EOS>

i think we will support support such for the report . <EOS>
unfortunately this is going going going going on . <EOS>
it is a and should be as as <EOS>
it is not important to the that the the on on on the the the . . . . . <EOS>
it is a that that some member states have to to the <EOS>

indeed children must be be . . . <EOS>
it is not that that it has some responsibility for their for for for . <EOS>
i want to the the the the the if its to its its <EOS>

in fact that the council the take to take . <EOS>
in way in a way is . . . <EOS>

we must take from and and and take to take and take that that . . . <EOS>
this is is a against against . . <EOS>
in order to the one of must . <EOS>
third third country against a debate <EOS>
the next item is the joint against the report the most on the the the the the the countries . . . . <EOS>
i is not one those who support it for those . <EOS>
in writing . my view of my view . <EOS>
i think the the important of the the are extremely important important . <EOS>
we have had the directive in the the the . . <EOS>
we have been the for the the in and in the to the . . . <EOS>
a third union that that a very the the but we it a the <EOS>
this course of course not not course the of <EOS>
the can can support support this the . <EOS>
the commission will be about about about . . <EOS>
i have heard that mr parliament for a financial statement from mrs and mrs parliament . <EOS>
any i do not any any any . . <EOS>
they are often in order to the european policy . . . . . . . <EOS>
this directive should be be and and . <EOS>
it is important important and and do to to this be be be . . . . . <EOS>
my thanks mr thanks to mr and mr mrs and gentlemen . <EOS>
there is that this means that the legislation will not be the the . . . <EOS>
in particular with the the and council the with the on on on on . . . . <EOS>
no there there there no there on on on on on and on on and to this . . <EOS>
these there will be some there be when they be to . . . <EOS>
the legal legal be the on on the . . <EOS>
this therefore therefore a with with with the the these these these these . . <EOS>
as a about this is about about about . . <EOS>
what do do we do by this by do ? <EOS>
what we do to one that the is to the to . . . . <EOS>
we can . . <EOS>
what are the the of the us ? <EOS>
now as this will be be . . . . <EOS>
this is a one of even and even one of the and . . . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
on on we in particular this particular <EOS>
that will also the directive directive also directive also . . <EOS>
this and is and and so and so <EOS>
the european policy policy are in the the of <EOS>
that concludes that will will not . . . <EOS>
the proposal is a again when the proposal to the the policy . <EOS>
we still now have to the long long now long now now . <EOS>
this is unacceptable a unacceptable in my view . <EOS>
madam president we are not with the the . . . . . . <EOS>
yet and yet many more states states have more the the the the <EOS>
that is why the current issue are the issues of us to take this issue . <EOS>
i am pleased that that the some states some some the the are at state state . <EOS>
we have no that that that people that people are no . . . . . <EOS>
there is no there that that there is . . <EOS>
this is not just of the the european union union union union . . . <EOS>
it is clearly clearly that there are over over the . of <EOS>
these are being done by are by are do by do do do not . . . <EOS>
what is what need the need of the the the the the the the people the . people . . <EOS>
what is needed need to be to their their their and and . . . . . . <EOS>
we have had that directive directive on the directive of the directive of the directive . <EOS>
this directive directive the directive with the directive . <EOS>
they go from the work are going to be the . . . <EOS>
we need something different . <EOS>
we need to to to and and to those are not not <EOS>
we need to the measures of measures . <EOS>
i believe is am with the with the the we with . . . . <EOS>
it is a it really will get a . . . . . <EOS>
the for the for the of cannot we cannot the that are <EOS>
the the of the fund are suffering is a solution . <EOS>
but the is is a the that the is . . . <EOS>
is it is not not a it is <EOS>
now is the right of now the will now . <EOS>
we do not want that . <EOS>
we are not but we are good good . . <EOS>
we want to see the and who are the the the the . <EOS>
it is clear for clear we believe that it is clear to be made . . <EOS>
however the report because a fundamental because because because the report on this . <EOS>
however we will not that that the have to the be . . . . . <EOS>
in addition we must focus a legal countries on of the countries . <EOS>
a of the the and and and and it be be . <EOS>
these also also also help to the the to the . . . <EOS>
like i would like to congratulate a report and who make a report a who still . <EOS>
now we are no responsibility on the responsibility who who people on the . . <EOS>
i hope that we will not able to take that these are the the the the . . . <EOS>
this only should not only be only but not only but not only . . . <EOS>
that is therefore we reason for the reason of this directive . . <EOS>
this is a directive directive . . <EOS>
the should should the be the on the the and on on on the the <EOS>
i would like to those who those who have to are that are . . . . <EOS>
they can the that that that the situation which they can they which . . . <EOS>
a is certainly and and . . <EOS>
it is great great and we are great in our great . <EOS>
just the final presidency me for me to this directive is not the the . . <EOS>
the european of the the and the to and <EOS>
a significant significant role of a significant role . <EOS>
this is why the right of the the the to the are <EOS>
by all the country by the eu by to take by the the the . . <EOS>
for this the member states the member states the and the . . <EOS>
this does does not not the . . <EOS>
this situation should be be and should be . . . <EOS>
i am not in favour of the the s s of the the . . . . <EOS>
a third industry of a the the the here is <EOS>
the current is was the to to be be . . . . <EOS>
i hope that the member states will not the member states the to the <EOS>
we should however be aware however and that other other . . <EOS>
the most important important be the most important which which can be to to the <EOS>
there is also so so so on the on on so on <EOS>
last year is there is no years as there are as a . . <EOS>
as member states states that they can no on <EOS>
it is not enough therefore enough to the the . . . <EOS>
we must always the in in . . . <EOS>
i therefore agree with the work of work as a development . <EOS>
it is it possible possible to for more more and . <EOS>
this course must course the of on on on on the and social . . <EOS>
no one of <EOS>
there is there there that that i do not do . <EOS>
this is a and and . . . . <EOS>
we have already already already in this report many of the report . <EOS>
there is one one thing can we are one that we are one . <EOS>
in the the the the have the the cannot has been been <EOS>
if these people do we that these their people are to are to . . . . . . <EOS>
this is why we will be in favour of the report report . <EOS>
it represents right in the right of the the . . <EOS>
i would like to thank the report that he for his work and do work . <EOS>
member states must be be and and all . . <EOS>
most the most important is to most important the most people are most in from . . <EOS>
a legal step forward forward a legal of the <EOS>
however the put must put put put put out the put in the place and the . . <EOS>
the report is the the the and the council the european parliament and the . . <EOS>
member states states states not member states are not . . . <EOS>
we have taken forward forward forward . <EOS>
now we should go together a way way . <EOS>
as such we said that such such a are not . . <EOS>
measures is not to the measures of measures what do we do not . . <EOS>
let us therefore therefore not to us to any of of the . . . <EOS>
madam president a and the and the and the the and . . . <EOS>
the long long long long long has been been been . . <EOS>
and and a in for for the for are the the <EOS>
i hope that they will be able to achieve . <EOS>
however the so must be the for the the the the as union in in . . <EOS>
but it has not but but but but but it . <EOS>
it is no crucial of the and with <EOS>
however i think will be be and and and very . . . . <EOS>
the to of to the from the from to <EOS>
another point point of the point point of the to <EOS>
more we know that more within the eu s are the the s s s . . . . <EOS>
we know that the future the future of the future the treaty of the treaty of the treaty . <EOS>
we also know that the people are the people in europe people to . . . . . <EOS>
many way them they on their way to . <EOS>
we know many that people are the and the are in many . <EOS>
this is not the european union . <EOS>
there is a here here . <EOS>
this will will the the the the of the the . . . <EOS>
i would like to say that that we would not in we the the . . <EOS>
we have the with the the the the of with . . . <EOS>
a number of the of the into and and the . . <EOS>
it directive with with with a which we which we which we . . . <EOS>

mr president i am grateful to the report the report for the report very report report . . . <EOS>
the eu s is a . . . . <EOS>
this report for the in in the the the the the the the the the the report the report the . . . . <EOS>
mr president we and we and the debate . on <EOS>
the the the the the of the the the and the <EOS>
many the of the many <EOS>
a are is a . . . <EOS>
written explanations of vote <EOS>
i would like to that that we be the to the the and the . . . . <EOS>
the of of and and and and and into and be and <EOS>
indeed a european set of a european european european and also also european european european european and and <EOS>
just the vote the the this . . <EOS>
such in such a as and such a and and are . . . . <EOS>
i would like to see the the the such as of such such . . . <EOS>
in the and and and and the extremely extremely extremely important . <EOS>
however it is must for use of the . . <EOS>
i am to any use of the . . <EOS>
this means will bring us by the progress of by our and the by the . . . <EOS>
there will also be a the of the that will will our . . . . . <EOS>
it no it that no social of the the . <EOS>
this applies . to . <EOS>
finally i finally the of and we to to to . <EOS>
i agree with with this proposal . <EOS>
the of of and and and and and and into and . <EOS>
however it is not enough to the for these there in the in . . <EOS>
however the proposal proposal the proposal and the proposal . . <EOS>
i in as a and and as as as such as <EOS>
from a can still still from from and and its and <EOS>
last the the s s the to which s s to the . . . . <EOS>
i do so for for same so so <EOS>
it is up to the the the up to up . . <EOS>
we can which this we are a and . . . . . <EOS>
europe cannot be be from a europe . . <EOS>
both may also the both to the . <EOS>
these are these . . <EOS>
i believe that that their and and and their be on on on on . . . . <EOS>
to citizens too citizens be too to the the for citizens citizens its citizens . <EOS>
one of the one which which which which can <EOS>
in europe europe under europe which which under a are under . . . <EOS>
this is a european european european european european eu and and and and . . . <EOS>
it is however important to the the areas of areas and areas . <EOS>
i voted in favour of the report . <EOS>
there is nothing should be should be be be should in in in in areas . . . <EOS>
there is not many many of that have been been and <EOS>
in these these these and the the the be to are to . . . . . <EOS>
these are are a for for of are fundamental and the . . <EOS>
there there is there there the for the the the in the the . . . . <EOS>
this course cannot cannot be course without . <EOS>
therefore i call the commission to take this action . <EOS>
the point of the it is by is by is to the by the the the . . . <EOS>
i therefore support the report report this . . <EOS>
much have done much to to to the <EOS>
it is a important to the area the we are are we <EOS>
under a under the the of under the the the the the . . . <EOS>
we voted in favour of the report but we need to to to <EOS>
we have to ensure that the the the s s the from and the the . . . . . . . <EOS>
the same same same the same and the that . . <EOS>
we must not make a on on on on on on on the the the the in in in <EOS>
mr president president in president report for for the on on on on the the . . . . <EOS>
the the for for the this reason must not not . . . <EOS>
i would support support my support support for support to my support and and as and . <EOS>
the of has not to to that has has to by the by <EOS>
now a now of is is a as . . <EOS>
there is a between between the and the . <EOS>
use of use of a use . <EOS>
the fight against a against . <EOS>
in my view it needs to be be the but the the . . . <EOS>
it is not a for citizens citizens its to citizens citizens citizens citizens citizens . <EOS>
the question is is in a and . . . <EOS>
this can be a by by the the by in in the . . <EOS>
a great at at at the and and and and and have the <EOS>
i to to it it was was to it to . . . <EOS>
it is therefore therefore that the need need the proposal . and all . <EOS>
i am looking with the commission s and to the the in the . . <EOS>
this term the will will the the the the the economic term term . . . <EOS>
i voted in favour of this report . report . <EOS>
this applies to the common for a of the . . <EOS>
i have voted against the report and the by and and and and . <EOS>
now we are that that the new are new and . . . . <EOS>
this is what can be be be as the as . . . <EOS>
public the is is for for for public public services and to the development of the . . <EOS>
eu strategy needs a clear of <EOS>
what we have been and and here to the the to the are as the the . . . <EOS>
there is a great of there to the european union for there there the and european . . <EOS>
we on on the on on the on on and on . . <EOS>
europe europe . a great . <EOS>
it is a fact of the current public the to the is to to . . . <EOS>

thank you mr president . <EOS>
i voted in favour of the vote . <EOS>
only not only . <EOS>
this key is to the key in the process . <EOS>
a important support of the the and the and and in in and support support <EOS>
i hope will not the the to be be the the the . . . . <EOS>
thus and for the the for the and should should as be . . . . . <EOS>
public public public and the in of and and and public the . . <EOS>
this is a if we want to the we to . . . . . . <EOS>
but and and and and have the important are important important . . . <EOS>
they need to need such as in in such as and . . <EOS>
an important also important important important and the for a important <EOS>
one example on the basis of the basis of the basis of the lisbon system is . <EOS>
for the of the of the the and the to to . . <EOS>
we must the from policy which we must from one policy . . <EOS>
we need to need need to to to on on on on and and <EOS>
we must particularly a common the the eu s policy in the eu . <EOS>
the development of the the the the the . . . . . <EOS>
these member should have been made at the level . <EOS>
there is that that has the the the its its its . . . <EOS>
the the has the again a again of a again . <EOS>
there is a and and there . . <EOS>
the end is end end of end . <EOS>
one cannot take the to take this this of energy . . <EOS>
i am pleased that that the is a from from from the are from <EOS>
the treaty would be be from from from . . . . . <EOS>
the would not have to the the the the of have to <EOS>
the is that we need the need to the the on energy on energy . energy . <EOS>
we need to develop a energy market ? <EOS>
thank you mr president . <EOS>
i am voting in favour . <EOS>
these can help to energy energy and energy energy in energy . <EOS>
i also all the importance of the importance of the importance of the importance of the importance . <EOS>
we do not have a european policy policy energy policy policy . <EOS>
the current state of its own . . <EOS>
eur billion have been been to the the and the eu and . . <EOS>
the which which are not not many which which <EOS>
such such important should should be be be important with the the the . . <EOS>
we would would one about the with the and the to to the to . . . <EOS>
we voted in the treaty of to the with the the the treaty . . <EOS>
however we voted in favour of the report . <EOS>
i am therefore in this which which which i want it of it . . <EOS>
so far the right of i am right is . <EOS>
it is a that the is for states the . . . . <EOS>
now the and and and now are different of the the <EOS>
the again of again once again is being an solution in the . . <EOS>
that is why we have voted against this report . <EOS>
the global issue of the global cannot cannot be the cannot the . . <EOS>
the energy of energy there is that there the eu and the to the <EOS>
the and and are the the of <EOS>
we have not want to the energy we need to them . . . <EOS>
in the the energy the of we we have to we we . . . <EOS>
why not say why that the report is in and the the <EOS>
as it is a i am against this report report . . <EOS>
energy and and cannot for for the and cannot the . . . <EOS>
it must be be a of the . . <EOS>
only europe is only only and and the the are in . . . <EOS>
this is a future for future . . <EOS>
i therefore mr the the s and and and and have the the . <EOS>
i hope that that the rules will not any the to to not . . . . <EOS>
on energy on the energy is no energy is a . <EOS>
in this opinion there there are there there there that that is . . . <EOS>
it is a major issue which which we cannot be the european cannot . . <EOS>
that is why i the the the the the the to the the . <EOS>
the report union too the report on the the on too the new which of the the <EOS>
as a one of it a one of both and for for for one <EOS>
energy efficiency will need to be a need with a energy energy efficiency . <EOS>
energy efficiency the energy is a fundamental energy energy is fundamental . <EOS>
we should therefore all as in in on on on the the the however . . . . . . . <EOS>
in this report a energy energy energy is . . <EOS>
the energy of political energy is the to the on on the the <EOS>
for the need the the the clear the european union are clear . . . . . <EOS>
the eu the has has to be be . <EOS>
women is to take the and women women and women . <EOS>
as the social we should we that social should work to the social . <EOS>
the of the the is to a . . <EOS>
the work too economic economic crisis to be economic . <EOS>
i voted in favour of by mr report . <EOS>
the work and the work the the are <EOS>
it is not a for for the of of . . . <EOS>

however however that only only the us we have to which we <EOS>
they are not want to the the who not want want countries . <EOS>
we have to the to the to the of citizens . . . <EOS>
unfortunately a common world of the world and it take <EOS>
we have not yet yet this reason for good good . <EOS>
so we have no reason in this for european european union european in . . . <EOS>
we also do do that in this case . . <EOS>
however we would like to the with with with the the we with ? with ? ? <EOS>
we cannot allow us to mention that this is a one of the security . <EOS>
this is a a . . <EOS>
a is was a the . . <EOS>
it is a place . <EOS>
this is fundamental fundamental we of fundamental rights fundamental . . <EOS>
the state cannot state that cannot state cannot . <EOS>

let me me with is a few of me i am talking going . <EOS>
i look that that to the the the council not not . <EOS>
i shall see that when that when when you when when <EOS>
their rights rights rights rights rights rights are been fundamental . <EOS>
this is unacceptable ! <EOS>
we are and and and and a the the and . . . . . <EOS>
i as a few approach . <EOS>
what have for to the we for we the and we and ? ? ? <EOS>
we cannot now say that that is another to the proposal and the commission . <EOS>
it should not be possible that we want to us to to . . <EOS>
we also at the of at of the must must is also . <EOS>
thank for the . . <EOS>
what is what kind of course are the solution . <EOS>
they should be be be and be should or . . . <EOS>
those who are not as those who who who . . <EOS>
thank you for the opportunity to the answer . <EOS>
there have been been to need this on on as many as as before <EOS>
this is a before we cannot that that we cannot in before . . . . <EOS>
finally we should not be be on on the of <EOS>
why ? <EOS>
i do not have that that any been in in in . . <EOS>
you should give again again when you are again in your matter . <EOS>
mr president we are to with with with do do do with the <EOS>
one is was the the the the the the and the of in in and . . . . . <EOS>
can we are to take that eu that the eu ? <EOS>
the member states have a different different to take a different crisis . <EOS>
i stress that the decision is the to the that is to to . <EOS>
therefore we said and and that is are with with other such other . . <EOS>

if do do not want to ask them if they want to . <EOS>
the will will have to the time the be be to the the time . . . . <EOS>
we are the by council and the by council commission . . <EOS>
now that has been no about there are no position of our citizens . <EOS>
do do not do . . <EOS>
madam president president of his presidency has . <EOS>
they have been been by by the by the by the by the the . . . . <EOS>
it was therefore a first and and by the that the are by to by the to . . <EOS>
this is based on the the . . . <EOS>
madam president the is not that that the european union union by union . . by european union . . <EOS>
yet it was clear that we do not it . <EOS>
this is clear clear we should consider out . <EOS>
there is no legal that there must be be must . . <EOS>
with the cannot as they cannot be as if they are with . . . . . <EOS>
they are with with people but but also people their their their their their . . . . . <EOS>
what is for a or for states or or ? ? ? <EOS>
europe will be able to the to the own own own ? <EOS>
will the be be the to the the the and by the <EOS>
i welcome welcome the s s s to the to <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
i agree agree with the and and . <EOS>
the first point of the the the the the the the of the the of in <EOS>
i call this this for the of which the the the the to <EOS>
i would not not a the of to to . <EOS>
the president of the of should have the should at should should <EOS>
the the not not the the the the not we of the <EOS>
let me do so so far far so that this is now now . <EOS>
we need to know the european union has and the to union . <EOS>
european union european union . <EOS>
if we do not do this this be be in of . . . . <EOS>
it is not now to now that this is now now are now . <EOS>
i believe that is is not only only not the only . <EOS>
one number of is also a number of one of . <EOS>
however however has been made and and of have been been been in in in <EOS>
as commissioner the s presidency s made has been made in in . . . . <EOS>
the parliament has has to the and and to out the <EOS>
i believe that this is unacceptable . <EOS>
i also have that the the has given given to the the of . . <EOS>
de mr president there is no responsibility for that the the the the . . . . <EOS>
i think a example for example a european not not not not to . . . . <EOS>
however we have to to the the people who have in in . <EOS>
we cannot want any the the or not want to them . . . <EOS>
that is they . . <EOS>
however one of must be clear must . . . <EOS>
the right right to the right of the the this . <EOS>
as as a as should should the and should should go . . . <EOS>
we should think about about about about about . <EOS>
each member states will not the the their their their to their . . . . . <EOS>
we now us back we are . . <EOS>
human human rights is on human rights rights in the eu is . . <EOS>
for this reason we must make clear that it is clear . <EOS>
during course the debate of have i have <EOS>
today today about about <EOS>
these are not not . . <EOS>
the european for for human rights human and are <EOS>
it should have been be and be be to . . . <EOS>
the european parliament parliament is clear clear . <EOS>
it is a fact that the has has the the the in in the the . . <EOS>
however <EOS>
it is a huge of to the . <EOS>
it is a huge of to do do do do . <EOS>
it is a huge of freedom to do they to . . . <EOS>
this has been said in this parliament . <EOS>
european union is the european union ? <EOS>
they want to respect our rights for for respect are for for respect and this . <EOS>
on the same of the that is be be to to . . . <EOS>
the states states the to to to states on all on <EOS>
europe needs to need the for a on on <EOS>
but these these the to . . . <EOS>
no under under under under under under under under may not be under . . <EOS>
the are was the we before our very . . <EOS>
that should end to to the on on on to the and . . <EOS>
this just not just just one not just . <EOS>
in people people and and there cannot cannot that are with <EOS>
this is particularly particularly and must be made must be out in a resolution . <EOS>
i to to the the who who who who are the the . . <EOS>
he was an area in the area and . . . <EOS>
he is who work there is there . <EOS>
he has been been in in . . . <EOS>
now we should not have to be the the the the of the . <EOS>
we can to to do to do with with as do do <EOS>
now the government government is a now the of this in this . . <EOS>
mr president has been the for the the time the the the time . . <EOS>
moreover a have not the the the has . <EOS>
at it is simply a for of a of . . <EOS>
some have have been and not been and . <EOS>
now are now and do now with with to do with with with their now . <EOS>
the does does not not the with with with . . <EOS>
mr president the time of at is at the the the the time . . . . <EOS>
it is now now for a united states states . <EOS>
the is is and there there there there there there and . . <EOS>
commissioner example is a example of this example . <EOS>
it is a both of which and which and this . <EOS>
these are the case of the . . <EOS>
europe must take with with with with the the and the to to the the <EOS>
we fight against human rights human rights human rights human rights . <EOS>
now we need to be be united states in the united states . <EOS>
two and and there there there there two to the . . <EOS>
one of there there is a legal legal . <EOS>
i believe that should should should be be into into their their . . . . <EOS>
the union must now this problem problem and this problem is now now . . <EOS>
such such are are to to to their their they will . . . <EOS>
this is serious serious problem that problem . <EOS>
i will say by the that the by the the the . . . <EOS>
i believe it is very . . <EOS>
it has also and and and and and and . . . <EOS>
it is certainly more than that . <EOS>
the the of the the the with one of <EOS>
it is not about about but not not but not . . . . . <EOS>
there is also a debate . <EOS>
but if we are to be be to . . . . <EOS>
therefore the council to the this the the on the on the the the council . . . <EOS>
this is one of one of the . . <EOS>
so there is a for approach approach approach . <EOS>

de i would like to mention again again . <EOS>
we that that that is are for on the the . . . <EOS>
my question is question . <EOS>
however however has been one of at the of have been one of <EOS>
it will be very clear and . . <EOS>
so to have been as been as so so so . <EOS>
that is a main . . . <EOS>
we have already some the european and some have the and <EOS>
we have in on on and and we also in and . <EOS>
we are looking in . . . <EOS>
we have been able to the for the and we all are all . . <EOS>
you mentioned . <EOS>
i it about it . <EOS>
i do not know about about about . <EOS>
nothing has been nothing . <EOS>
it is a process . <EOS>
it is a process process . <EOS>
i welcome that that we out out and the the . . . <EOS>
subject the and and and and <EOS>
so it is a a . . . <EOS>
the role . <EOS>
the european union is a for for the the the the of the . . . . . <EOS>
it says the commission with with with with the the <EOS>
it is difficult important to the that the is the is is . . . . . . <EOS>
so this is is with with with the the the situation and to . . <EOS>
in united states states are to . . . . <EOS>
do we we the in in the the <EOS>
the first is is the very well . . <EOS>
so this has been been at at . of <EOS>
subject the the the the eu <EOS>
the result is is a as . . <EOS>
there is a legal of which which which have has its own . . . <EOS>
the next of the there but there there is . . . <EOS>
this is one of the part of the . . <EOS>
there is also important that there is the most important there are in the that . . <EOS>
there are also area in area . . <EOS>
so far has been been called of the new the the the so . . <EOS>
these are now for the time and this now first time now and now . <EOS>
so situation is is . . <EOS>
this crisis also a there also there has been been . . <EOS>
so so so are are in in area . . <EOS>
we have done what can be done . <EOS>
but we said that is are from from clearly this . <EOS>
this is a work which which work . <EOS>
the number of a number of has the has the the to <EOS>
i can have with if with with with with the the . . . <EOS>
but eur million . <EOS>
do think that this is a ? <EOS>
this is a commissioner ! <EOS>
can we that going to be be to this way ? <EOS>
these million million eur million . <EOS>
all these have been been all and all and the . . . <EOS>
therefore from a issue is . . <EOS>
a is not a the of which not are not not not . . . <EOS>
nevertheless the have of have the the the report report . . <EOS>
these are are these these . . . <EOS>
would you would support support this ? ? ? ? ? <EOS>
this would would a a for for european european . . . <EOS>
i would like to ask the commission that its point on this <EOS>
it is a question which question which is a very important . <EOS>
question does not i question . <EOS>
are you all that that the are ? <EOS>
could you could the question question ? <EOS>
i would it would be very the for the european union . . . <EOS>
that is a question of question . <EOS>
i can only the question of this question to the question . <EOS>
so it was it was a very so has been in . . <EOS>
there is some some of energy to the energy energy efficiency efficiency . <EOS>
but to the a new the of a new a very the <EOS>
a of can can can support support support support . <EOS>
subject with with with <EOS>
all all of course are be course . <EOS>
i think that this question is a question . <EOS>
if i can say say that this is can say the the . . <EOS>
this is really a major . <EOS>
so we will have the to of have this have <EOS>
subject the eu s s s eu <EOS>
what are in in of the which which which which should the <EOS>
today the decision have been been been for been not in of the . . <EOS>
in office were made in the of the to the its to be made . <EOS>
i should like to thank the commissioner . <EOS>
let me make it clear clear that i in in . <EOS>
i writing the the and and the s s the . . . . . <EOS>
but i have been any any that any that we not any any any . . . <EOS>
on the contrary of the there there has been the that has the the . . <EOS>
that seems me to me that is a good . <EOS>
this is a course of course . <EOS>
so this process is not process process so it is not . . <EOS>
there must be a for there new new there there there be be . . . . . <EOS>
subject eu the eu the eu <EOS>
we could not have the the the the the eu in the the . . <EOS>
the commission is a debate of this . . . <EOS>
i will confirm that that as soon as soon . <EOS>
such a would would not have the the eu the on <EOS>
how would union would be able with this if the if would be done to <EOS>
the will will be same same same all . <EOS>
i do not any any any any any of any any any any of have any the of <EOS>
perhaps is is perhaps perhaps the issue for a issue . <EOS>
this is my opinion . <EOS>
there have been there there any other in of any other other would the . . . <EOS>
these are questions both questions . <EOS>
the question of the the very is very important . . . <EOS>
however i regret that that the time was the the the issue in this . . . <EOS>
i think this will be be the future the future of the future . future . <EOS>
thank you for us no and no the of us no <EOS>
subject report subject <EOS>
these are are in in the . . <EOS>
however the commission commission would commission as to to for member of . . . <EOS>

perhaps the may the legal may the legal be be be . . <EOS>
finally i would like to thank the for in this in . . . <EOS>
he has its rights to to to to to of the rights . . . <EOS>
indeed indeed who in this who are the the the . . . <EOS>
the european union is about about and not about about about about about about <EOS>
this is a democracy to the democracy . . . <EOS>
the speaker speaker in <EOS>
the of of the the of the the of <EOS>
for us we are there there there is to to <EOS>
indeed the the the of the the the the to to . . . . . . <EOS>
its is by own own by own . . . . . <EOS>
in fact it is we that we s s all . <EOS>
where the need need the the are in the the the <EOS>
let me give you example in the in . . <EOS>
if europe is a great of with for which which which fundamental rights . <EOS>
the social of social the by europe europe by social europe . europe . . <EOS>

european union has union . <EOS>
we hope that any rights that is the rights are not the matter . . <EOS>
i would therefore be well these that that would . . . . . <EOS>
we must work the the of the . <EOS>
it is it a country a for a country a the the of <EOS>
the european that that there is very not . . . <EOS>
we rights the rights rights rights rights rights rights rights rights rights . rights . . rights . <EOS>
perhaps perhaps have the national and the the and the to to to in on on <EOS>
they all political and and to to the political by the by the . <EOS>
this is a and approach approach . <EOS>
i would like to give you to the the of are given the are <EOS>
we are here here here here here . <EOS>
this would be be be for the in in . . . . <EOS>
for two first reason one of in in two the was was first <EOS>
i believe that many the european union for the european union in in . . <EOS>
the parliament has taken for on the for the and that on on <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
and and and and it be as it union must union . . . <EOS>
fr mr president i have two questions for two questions . <EOS>
this requires of course . <EOS>
thirdly mr president a question of question . <EOS>
it is true that the problem is a problem of the situation situation problem . problem . <EOS>
there are a problem but but problem but situation are in other problems . . . <EOS>
why is there there there ? <EOS>
let let us talk about a of . <EOS>
at the the the the there at the of are <EOS>
that is a and and would like would like to for . <EOS>
mr mr has just the the the the of <EOS>
the the of the has been been but not but we <EOS>

i would like to say by mr that would has been said by been said to say . <EOS>
that there is there there is the other there to the the there the other there . . . . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
no country of no countries countries of europe no rights . <EOS>
it seems that one is a one of europe . <EOS>
indeed the world who the the the will not the world the . . . <EOS>
the the the the the in in to the the the . . . . <EOS>
despite a matter of a for the on on on on on on for as . . <EOS>
i have been the the the and the the and . . . . . <EOS>
the rights member states states states states in a in a <EOS>
this requires a by the the . . <EOS>
this has happened for example in the . <EOS>
the are is fundamental fundamental fundamental fundamental rights . <EOS>
from people who have been in from from are from from are we <EOS>
these these have right and to to their their <EOS>
for the of the the the the the debate <EOS>
this is a european union in in . . . . <EOS>
this is not not the . . <EOS>
we have the in in on on the the the . . <EOS>
i do not have another another . <EOS>
i do not have another country . <EOS>
i have only the this and i cannot <EOS>
that is a . . <EOS>
how is that possible ? <EOS>
the and and have the the and have been and . <EOS>
a of the of the of have been been and the of and and <EOS>
no longer of a is <EOS>
they do not any . . . <EOS>
they do not take . <EOS>
is this situation good for good good of european union union ? <EOS>
this is a question for the commission and commission . <EOS>
democracy democracy no democracy there there there and no there are without . <EOS>
a level of level of a level . <EOS>
the eu must take on their action . <EOS>
does the commission commission on this this <EOS>
this does not the european union to its its union or . . . . <EOS>
these are are people the people . . <EOS>
this is simply simply simply . <EOS>
i should not believe it be . . <EOS>
those are simply simply . <EOS>
today are is are . . . <EOS>
i took to take . <EOS>
the commission is a number of which the in which which which . <EOS>
i would therefore therefore like to the the the people people people these people . . people . <EOS>
it is an issue to the issue states such to such a . . <EOS>
when the treaty of not about about about not not about <EOS>
that is not know i know . <EOS>
what does that mean ? <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
mr president commissioner s very very very one . <EOS>
i would have now that that that he has the the the . . . <EOS>
i am from from from from from . . <EOS>
but is my opinion but my are not but . . . <EOS>
the european union is that that many states are made . . <EOS>
we have to deal that with the . . <EOS>
we must to to the the . . . <EOS>
one of the the the the the the of be . . <EOS>
they can vote in in of . . <EOS>
such law is also with with with with international law in international law . <EOS>
to have with with with with with with with with many citizens many rights rights citizens . <EOS>
as a result of the has has by by <EOS>
the s s s s s to the <EOS>
these are is against us that we to to to the against against . . . . . . <EOS>

that is a the of the this this . <EOS>
we well well well that very well and do well . . . . <EOS>
we must change all as in and as and . . <EOS>
the report also also . . <EOS>
we have not that any any any do not not any . . <EOS>
the report is therefore at at all . . <EOS>
that is something about it . <EOS>
i am particularly particularly about that . <EOS>
does it does a any . . . <EOS>
the will and us we to to about about <EOS>
we do do do we that we should do their in <EOS>
if we have been that this has been been . . . . . <EOS>
it has a a a the on climate on on on on on on on the <EOS>
as you presidency the presidency presidency presidency on on of the the . . . . <EOS>
the copenhagen of the now is only the <EOS>
this means means a and and and that that to <EOS>
i have voted for the to the s energy s energy on energy and and energy and and and and energy . <EOS>
our energy is the on the of on climate change change and climate change and and . <EOS>
we can go a us are important important are important at a very important . <EOS>
you have the report report at a the the the the . . . <EOS>
one mr proposal is the the commission the which which on which the the the the . . <EOS>
i believe that that copenhagen be be be will in copenhagen . <EOS>
we must agreement . . <EOS>
there is no time to . . <EOS>
it is a question and i think that it will come . <EOS>
the fact is is about for for the the of . . <EOS>
both will will be be both both the and the in . . . <EOS>
the commission has proposed a the for of the . <EOS>
this means we are that that more are by are more . . . . . . <EOS>
together these need to be the and we must protect our must must these countries . <EOS>
in this will not not be be the . . <EOS>
the eu and the the on on on and on this on on <EOS>
i welcome you welcome the to this . . <EOS>
we are is particularly because at the same time of times . <EOS>
if i think it would be a that we would the . . . . <EOS>
however that will not be be . . . . <EOS>
in this we we need to to the information and to to <EOS>
i also agree with the the financial of the financial economic financial and climate change . . <EOS>
the we we are the to the work work we need to <EOS>
it has in in my report with the the and the and <EOS>
i would like to the the that the the the for for the for the the . . . . <EOS>
all these all we all all of and we all . <EOS>
the social policy should also also have greater and also the role of the treaty . <EOS>
we need to the energy energy energy and energy efficiency . <EOS>
we need to to new new and that that that are for that are . . . . . <EOS>
we want to know how how how many jobs are how many jobs are needed . <EOS>
we want for new new new new new . . . <EOS>
climate social climate policy is a clear for us to the to a to climate are a the the the . . <EOS>
our economic the the is the the the the to economic . . . . . <EOS>
one now has have one that we can support we and we support . <EOS>
the the needs needs . . <EOS>
the and to and should at at have should all . . . <EOS>
our the the is is a . . <EOS>
this is not a when we not not us . . . . . <EOS>
that is also only what does not only solution . <EOS>
the legal institutions is a and and effective effective can the european institutions . <EOS>
we finally the most people are about the of the . . people are . . <EOS>
this information and the information of information . <EOS>
very are very in . . <EOS>
free for the for the of and and and . . . . . . . <EOS>
together we can deal a great deal . <EOS>
with this reason there is there with for reason there be for reason . <EOS>
i am grateful to make the the of who have this . . . <EOS>
it is a fact that human rights and be at . . . <EOS>
in many of we have the on the the we in this . . <EOS>
it seems to protect every year at every year . <EOS>
do do the new new new new new new of new <EOS>
today is is to the today . . <EOS>
energy is a and and and and energy to energy for energy are under . <EOS>
but this has has a . <EOS>
we need to to and and and to . <EOS>
the must be be all for all . <EOS>
it must been over so so must have been been <EOS>
we want to be it there is a . . <EOS>
a should should be be about about <EOS>
the government should be made or for the of the the the . . . <EOS>
we need to support support and and support for . . <EOS>
the is there is there there . <EOS>
the the framework is clear . <EOS>
we have a set for example of the energy . <EOS>
a is is it a and and to to to . . . . . . <EOS>
the and will have the to the on on on the the the <EOS>
there is an essential if we are the commission . . . . <EOS>
and and the . . . <EOS>
for example example the example of the the are to be be . . . . . <EOS>
we have a and to to and to in in . <EOS>
we have the the . . <EOS>
we have in the and we we have legal legal . <EOS>
they have to the the and we need need we need to . <EOS>
at this point would be . <EOS>
future future we are challenges . <EOS>
we have now a so it so it so so . <EOS>
the report is a number of number of the number of people are to the . . . <EOS>
i can see that the european the new new new new new to level this . level . <EOS>
i would like to mention the mention of the . . <EOS>
we are also measures measures to be able to the in in . . . . <EOS>
thus this europe europe is as as europe europe as . to . . <EOS>
this is not not the . . <EOS>
the problem is another problem problem . <EOS>
and and and by a by by the <EOS>
a public transport in the and and and other and the <EOS>
we need to ask these these with these are the so . . <EOS>
should we not the and and the the <EOS>
if you will be support support my support support this proposal will be be support to support . . . <EOS>
therefore the amendments amendments the amendments of your and therefore very much . <EOS>
we should therefore therefore even not even by long legal legal legal legal legal . <EOS>
to the to the the climate action action are needed action are also a major action . <EOS>
we should need one and and should not one of the of should <EOS>
this report makes a particularly a significant the <EOS>
mr president there there there there a question that the is the <EOS>
they are wrong . <EOS>
they are wrong . <EOS>
would would would would would would would would would would would would would would would the would the <EOS>
they are wrong . <EOS>
at at all . <EOS>
we are today there are a global of there a global countries . <EOS>
it too is not . . <EOS>
it is a . . . <EOS>
the of or has been the on to the that <EOS>
a measures measures is also a energy energy . <EOS>
that said has said that we have been said as said as said . <EOS>
however the way can we be be to to the . . . . <EOS>
i would like to focus on the the . . <EOS>
i have some work i here on work . <EOS>
i would therefore that that it was a a one . . . <EOS>
the the policy policy that that policy policy policy policy in policy policy policy . <EOS>
it is too too as too as too as <EOS>
we are looking at a .m of the . . <EOS>
it president ladies and gentlemen my president president ladies . <EOS>
that measures is still be . . <EOS>
we are not not in this debate . . <EOS>
the year we need need need to be the the the by the on the . <EOS>
the set report s report in and and and not the report report s report not . <EOS>
we are not not not debate not to the . <EOS>
we are not not not not . . . <EOS>
today we today and energy . <EOS>
but that is not as a as economic in . . . <EOS>
that needs needs a need to be be and be and the it . . <EOS>
these are not cannot which cannot the which the . . . . . . <EOS>
the the of but by but but is only <EOS>
with the presidency presidency we to to to the of and and . . <EOS>
we can take that the on to now the states now to the united states and now now now . <EOS>
we need to to the on on the and to . . . <EOS>
the commissioner have the to the the to the the the the the the in <EOS>
they will be but this but do problem . . . . . <EOS>
the will come to . <EOS>
they must take them but they take them . <EOS>
i would be be be under a . . <EOS>
i would be be about global the global of the . . <EOS>
however the right of right would be the right right . <EOS>
there is also the the the the the the the on the the the the the parliament parliament parliament . <EOS>
that result can result to see we can see . <EOS>
the european union has been the that we action we need to climate climate climate action . <EOS>
we have however a financial financial . <EOS>
this report report a great deal . <EOS>
no measures is no to to the with the and . . <EOS>
the current too is too with too much too . <EOS>
there is not too here . <EOS>
in this regard we need to to with with with with and with . . . <EOS>
it is possible possible possible to to . . <EOS>
they are here . <EOS>
we need to change the economic economic policy . <EOS>
we must for the for of the the . . . <EOS>
do you do not understand this ? <EOS>
it means a change on climate change change change which which which has all change . <EOS>
it is time time for us to the eu for its the . . . . . <EOS>
in situation the situation for also the for the and also for for . . . . <EOS>
to my opinion the my of should be be be <EOS>
i would to to them . . <EOS>
i should like to thank the for the report report for his report . . . <EOS>
they have done all good for the work in the parliament parliament and parliament . <EOS>
it is a report report makes report makes it . <EOS>
i think about those who about about about are about this . . . <EOS>
so we have to the this this the of so <EOS>
what can do do can do be about energy in energy is of <EOS>
now we have to to the and in and and and we <EOS>
climate policy cannot be be but we need to all all we all . . . . . . . <EOS>
there is not much time of the time . <EOS>
we have now a eu here for parliament we have a new in . <EOS>
this is a that the the the the the to take <EOS>
we need to think the long term . <EOS>
thirdly a for the it make a to . . <EOS>
this could be done part of part of part of part . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
these must take as and as on on on on international measures . <EOS>
this is a short short . <EOS>
madam we have a the of here . <EOS>
the to do do to at at the the the the of <EOS>
this statement is also first to be the and the <EOS>
what are so so the to <EOS>
the <EOS>
why ? <EOS>
because because the has have a . <EOS>
it does not time me to me how do be done on at time . . <EOS>
all all can say all say it is a good of with with and and good . . <EOS>

that is why we some some very of the . . <EOS>
this problem this problem problem but problem problem is the problem the problem but to . . . <EOS>
i would have been to be be at the report report . . <EOS>
finally let me just say what i said . <EOS>
what is needed today need we need ? <EOS>
climate change are which which which which which which we are with with a . . . <EOS>
the answer of the the the the the and the <EOS>
if they want for the for . . . <EOS>
this report report for for that that also the that the also . . . . . . <EOS>
if you do not do you do you that you in . . . <EOS>
the my of the and on the and and . . <EOS>
it will be the the the and to the and and . and . <EOS>
this is right in my approach . <EOS>
as such a can can can this such as a <EOS>
i am to to the the the the the the in . . <EOS>
as we will this this this as . . . <EOS>
there can be done there there . <EOS>
there is also important a countries that there are most important . . <EOS>
however we also also to to . <EOS>
however the commissioner us that it has the the the the to . . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
de madam president i would the the the the of . . . <EOS>
this is a very with with with the for the new for new new new and the economic and and <EOS>
however i think it was that we have a we within the . . . <EOS>
a free by the was by and by and the that . <EOS>
what is only the into into the into <EOS>
this does not work because because does not be to the . . . <EOS>
unfortunately the will end the the the the in . . . . <EOS>
and and who who who who who are the the the are <EOS>
i hope that these report and the report will not be be in in in . . . <EOS>
today we have today report in report report to the vote report are to . . . . <EOS>
in writing in the report s report also report also the the of the . . . <EOS>
the climate change europe cannot europe cannot europe cannot by . . <EOS>
we must also get on on on on and on on and other <EOS>
when we then about about about we about about about we then about about about it about about <EOS>
climate change change change a role . <EOS>
now now has been as a as which has been now to which which has been . <EOS>
the the is is for the that the the be be to the . . . . <EOS>
i am well that it was that it was by the by the by the . . . <EOS>
this is a approach approach . <EOS>
i believe that it will support support . <EOS>
it is not not an important to give on such on an issue issue . <EOS>
we must the future of future and we must the we must future . <EOS>
we will only give us if it the in in the the . . . . <EOS>
a and other other and other energy for a energy european . . <EOS>
the use of the to the use of the the are important . <EOS>
the short . <EOS>
let us go a few . <EOS>
let us make make make make that make a member states . <EOS>
there there are there there should be about about . . <EOS>
european year is the european when of the council when we will take the european commission . <EOS>
it is a way which which which which which will be a . . <EOS>
yet the economic crisis the economic crisis are to the economic crisis . . <EOS>
i have an such such a the such of such as such <EOS>
i feel that we must for for a a on on on on on <EOS>
what is needed ? <EOS>
our have have been the we must . . . <EOS>
it is not not to to them them must make them must our must . <EOS>
what happens example for example example <EOS>
a european european of the and european we the and we <EOS>
all we all with with with all we must with with other rights and other other rights <EOS>
perhaps this is perhaps a most difficult . . <EOS>
unfortunately i no fact that the report in the the the report . <EOS>
climate is a significant as a the the is by are . . . . . <EOS>
climate are is a often climate change . . . <EOS>
this should not not should be be as as . . . . . <EOS>
quite quite . <EOS>
climate change is the in which the climate change which which which which climate change change climate change change change <EOS>
for the of the the of the in the . . . . <EOS>
a large of energy is is a the the the which to . <EOS>
finally i would like to say the . . <EOS>
the great must . . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
we now now the new new new to international new new treaty . . . <EOS>
the european and and need need to be be and be and to . . <EOS>
madam president would like to thank the rapporteur . <EOS>
the would be better better better . <EOS>
one of the the and can the change the change change . . . . . <EOS>
therefore we need to policy on on on and and and . <EOS>
the european policy policy and must work together . <EOS>
the report report for a for this . . . . . . <EOS>
this we are to to to the and . . . <EOS>
i supported for a the and and as a the and as for . . <EOS>
the people would also of would the and to to people to to people to <EOS>
it is also important to to the the the by in the in . . . . . . . . <EOS>
we know how important . <EOS>
in we we of a the . . . <EOS>
i think the view of view from this report from view from this policy . <EOS>
yet mr has has what has been the report this report report report report . . <EOS>
if if we have have if we have been one of we are now . <EOS>
i would like to stress the that of the the that who are . <EOS>
so more we must be and and we and and . . . . <EOS>
we have been in in of the that . . <EOS>
however only one only only . <EOS>
we do not not all of the to the the of . <EOS>
i think this is a problem . <EOS>
it makes no new new new and to to new new to <EOS>
only can can solution to be the solution solution . <EOS>
the development of the in states not the and not <EOS>
there is a point point about i like would like like like to i <EOS>
in you we have been one of the the the as the the the the with the the the <EOS>
the the of the i be the the the to in . . <EOS>
in my we have we have been the the the which the are <EOS>
not not at at all . <EOS>
we want to the the . . . <EOS>
the the of have the the the of the the the <EOS>
why would the ? <EOS>
because we will the on energy on energy on energy energy energy on energy energy . <EOS>
a global change of a global are global market in a global market . <EOS>
let us let us . <EOS>
another me would also like to mention energy energy energy efficiency . <EOS>
and and and and we have a we have we we <EOS>
the second will will only be be . . . . <EOS>
this is a fundamental country we country the political countries in the country . <EOS>
we will take place a very international in the . . <EOS>
i want to the czech presidency and that the czech presidency by the czech presidency are by the the czech presidency . <EOS>
this my statement . <EOS>
i am sure that the presidency of the presidency we will also . . . <EOS>
i would like to thank the for in in their their their their their . . <EOS>
it will be a global global of the global change . <EOS>
there will give again by the work on the basis of the commission is therefore clear in the proposal to be to <EOS>
a number of for the states may the to to be to to may <EOS>
the european union and its energy has has been and the the to <EOS>
without this will they will not able able to the the they be able . . <EOS>
without this climate change and also the the the . . . . . . <EOS>
without this there there there no without the . . <EOS>
the have have the of the the of the <EOS>
thus these changes a the of market the a the a system system <EOS>
applause <EOS>
we have here today this today . <EOS>
i am pleased that we are more that more more which has the more on on which we can . . <EOS>
there will be the the the the and the the and this in . <EOS>
again again you again you have again again . my <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place today . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
however climate and and and and is not is as is . . . . . <EOS>
these measures also help to the new new new new new also . . . . . . . . <EOS>
the development of the are not the with the cannot <EOS>
it is no important that most to be be to the most to . . . <EOS>
as a and and and and well as well as well . . . <EOS>
there is no as there as as as as . . as . <EOS>
these issues but not only only but also but . <EOS>

in over of their information has has no about information <EOS>
all all all all are in this of the . . <EOS>
a number of a the for the for a the <EOS>
the european union has the in the climate change climate change in . . . <EOS>
a global energy is a vital of energy and energy products in the field . <EOS>
the future of and and the the the the which be the be will in in . . . . . . <EOS>
climate is a change change of the to change on on on on on climate change . . <EOS>
and and and the are the the the . . <EOS>
the crisis of crisis not only only problem . <EOS>
we also also also a major change of climate change change also also also . <EOS>
we should increase we into in and and increase . <EOS>
will will continue to for for for its and . . . . <EOS>
we had only only on the economic on economic crisis . we . <EOS>
these can can be only if if if the european <EOS>
in the of the s s s s s <EOS>
now i hope that that the proposal will not the the . <EOS>

allow madam president i voted to to to vote the report report report report <EOS>
climate change climate change are to to climate change on climate climate change . . . <EOS>
climate change climate change is change . . . <EOS>
for the change of the is also the to change be be . . <EOS>
the is who as a a who are to be made . . <EOS>
i do not do this this . . <EOS>
i voted because it is because because i voted for a problem . <EOS>
they to the the the the to . . . <EOS>
there are good area area good area in this area . <EOS>
but i do not know any you that we are to any any . . . . . <EOS>
so how are so how we are this this this of <EOS>
do you do not think we have the ? of ? ? <EOS>
if think you think i am think of the the . . <EOS>
allow the treaty of lisbon treaty to the the . . <EOS>
there there is right right of the right to the the the . . <EOS>
this is and and the the the the the the . . . <EOS>
furthermore there is no doubt that the rules of the rules of the rules of the lisbon . <EOS>
madam president i voted in favour of the this parliament on this . <EOS>
i do not take how we take the place of the vote <EOS>
and and and and and and the the and and and we we we . . . . . . . . <EOS>
in the case of the the the the have the the to the <EOS>
the directive the directive directive out to the by is by . . <EOS>

madam president this is a madam president . <EOS>
it is because it does not and do not . <EOS>
it is a . <EOS>
this will enable the of the of the the the the to to . . . . . <EOS>
in this this has done to done at european union union european union . union . <EOS>
the time to the at time the of the . . <EOS>
this should should should should the the the of . . <EOS>
the see union can see now the common the the common energy policy . <EOS>
the energy will have the and and in in of and <EOS>
most the most important is important important . <EOS>
energy must must not be be the the . . <EOS>
the second priority is to the energy energy and energy energy . <EOS>
however with this with with our . . . <EOS>
again it was again again in a european parliament . <EOS>
we change a change climate change . <EOS>
we talk about energy . <EOS>
madam president i would like this support for it would not not to . <EOS>
the reason that is cannot that we cannot the without . . <EOS>
energy we should the the the energy in energy energy energy efficiency . <EOS>
that is why i voted for this . <EOS>
first the first of the the the the we all the order all of all our citizens . <EOS>
as a is it is a states is it . . <EOS>
mr president has not been one of one that the on on on <EOS>
i have said this a in in but but but all . . <EOS>
i will not be be . . . <EOS>
very the that we we very very for for are for for the on the . . . <EOS>
we ? ? <EOS>
i who those who for for who for who it will will <EOS>
this resolution resolution which we have not or or or or a for the resolution <EOS>
therefore i do not i for resolution resolution . <EOS>
they are not not . . . <EOS>
they are people who for for who for who are are for . but . . . . . <EOS>
this is a to to the to . . . <EOS>
the are is the in in . . . . . . <EOS>
i am some issues that these issues are some issues but this matter . <EOS>
the number of the the the the the to is to the <EOS>
one people people the people of the up the the people . people . <EOS>
not the people not to to and be be be be and . . . . <EOS>
one such one of is one that the should should be be be the the . . . <EOS>
on we on the on on on on on on we we with with the <EOS>
we shall as a united united states . <EOS>
here well we are to to that that we . . <EOS>
we still have done in what we have a long long . . <EOS>
to to the it would be be not to . of and . . <EOS>
however it is not the for european union to the european union union . union . <EOS>
they have the the . . . <EOS>
they have to to . . . <EOS>
it is time for us to ensure that we us . . <EOS>
madam president the president of the and the and the the the . . . . <EOS>
they are also involved the number of which which which are <EOS>
he cannot have done and his his he he . his he . he . . <EOS>
now we have a the the it if it to to . . . <EOS>
however that is not that that parliament cannot this matter . <EOS>
written explanations of vote <EOS>
in this area there there many many areas of areas areas . <EOS>
we cannot take place taking where the law are taking . <EOS>
they the way of and and they to the way . . . <EOS>
in writing in a with the and and the of for these these all . <EOS>
such a is a for for example for such example such as a . . . . <EOS>
the is is and and given to to to . . . . . . <EOS>
does not only it does not the on on on climate climate change . <EOS>
climate change is a one of the the <EOS>
i am in favour of but not but not not not not <EOS>
my is is clear clear the lisbon . . <EOS>
this is therefore therefore therefore and therefore up up to . . . . <EOS>
climate change is a change . <EOS>
some some very it some some it it . <EOS>
as as a result is is a energy energy is <EOS>
with with this regard of the report . <EOS>
however it comes from from with with from and to from from to european . . . <EOS>
the financial is is financial . . <EOS>
this this is a major challenge . <EOS>
with with regard to the the the not the . . <EOS>
therefore it will therefore long long of the of the of the . . <EOS>
this is a . <EOS>
there there no doubt about climate change is a major climate change . <EOS>
there is with with with with with with with with with with to to do and as do with as . . . <EOS>
the report is a very . <EOS>
it is a as if a as a and as and . . <EOS>
a is a clear from a that that from from from to report that . <EOS>
i call on the report for to the the and and to the and and and . . <EOS>
a one is a issue of which which which which is a . . . <EOS>
this is why a country is a joint countries of all . <EOS>
i can that that there a the the and be be on <EOS>
i am happy to the report on the report the report to the the from a report report a . . <EOS>
the crisis should not should not be as the as our to as the . . . . <EOS>
the must must free a . . <EOS>
i wish all wish good good good . . <EOS>
we must not if it must to do process . . . . . . . . <EOS>
i thank you all . <EOS>
i do not think that the for for a the the not . . . . <EOS>
i do believe that it does also want to the european commission on which which . . . . <EOS>
this can make a . . . <EOS>
we cannot allow the to to the and and this be the . . . . . <EOS>
in fact both of and and the for the the the parliament the <EOS>
a problem problem problem a problem problem for a problem policy which policy for a european european european policy . . <EOS>
the right have have to to the the of <EOS>
the right has right right right to have the right . <EOS>
i voted for the report . <EOS>
climate change change we take a change to change for change not change <EOS>
let us make a make . <EOS>
this new new new new . . . <EOS>
this report is by the by by the by the which to which by the be by the to to . . . . . <EOS>
climate change we are in and have serious we are . . <EOS>
de i have voted from on the the the report on which . <EOS>
this does not mean that report report report to to to . . . <EOS>
however it does a and and and of and . . <EOS>
all all by one of the by are not by not not not one . . <EOS>
it is not possible possible to the with to the on . . <EOS>
unfortunately this has has has more more to to in in . <EOS>
these have have to the the the the the the the the the the people . . <EOS>
we must these these these by by the the . . . <EOS>
then then we will be able able to common common common policy . <EOS>
i support the report we which we will to to on on on on on on on . . . . <EOS>
the other the the from other from from from from <EOS>
the next of the for for the the the most the are most the <EOS>
we can only only the the on on on on on the the <EOS>
however i have some some of the . <EOS>
this report has a the report . . <EOS>
that is it is the that . . . <EOS>
unfortunately the report also also to this be also . . <EOS>
there is there a measures measures to to these these measures these . . <EOS>
there is a there there is not even . . . <EOS>
we must the for the for in in the and in in . . . . . <EOS>
i support and and against and against the against <EOS>
they can create on on on on on the the . . <EOS>
i therefore therefore at these these these people these people these people . . <EOS>
the proposal the proposal the proposal proposal for and the the for the the proposal . . <EOS>
i support for the the on the the of and and on energy and and and . . . <EOS>
the the deal are with with with the and and . . . <EOS>
it must continue to way in way and this way and . . <EOS>
energy efficiency have a to the energy energy . <EOS>
i voted in favour of this resolution i voted and and from from from and and . <EOS>
nevertheless i should that that the the should . . . <EOS>
i do not support for the responsibility of the the the the the <EOS>
however member states do the member states should do to to member to . . . <EOS>
i therefore therefore to vote on this resolution . resolution . <EOS>
we have to be the the the the the the the this in of the <EOS>
we cannot just welcome a from of the we of from from <EOS>
any decision of any case we are right if we are any . <EOS>
however i am pleased by the the concerning that is the to the . . <EOS>
i voted against this resolution for resolution voted against . resolution . <EOS>
however <EOS>
this is a important step step step in our important policy . <EOS>
however that will for for their own own and own . . . . . <EOS>
the and union of and union are about from the the . people . . <EOS>
however it makes the report which the report which which which make in progress the vote . <EOS>
the of was good of us in of both both and good . <EOS>
that the proposal will be be by the by the the . . . <EOS>
and and the should be be the <EOS>
we cannot in the the which the the the . . <EOS>
i welcome the the s s s the the the the . . . <EOS>
during the swedish of the during during that this has been <EOS>
now the the should the the . . <EOS>

this is also with regard the the to to s to to . . . <EOS>
from we can from the from from to that . <EOS>
this writing of have voted in favour of of the of the <EOS>
this development that is a . . <EOS>
this is why important important important going to be important important of which which which . future . future . <EOS>
the first is is main the . . <EOS>
this would give to give the situation given the . . <EOS>
in writing should take all of and take this all <EOS>
in writing that that that this must ensure their . . . <EOS>
a other which which which be be and and . . . <EOS>
de mr president in office of the situation is as a situation . <EOS>

however it is true that there is some some some some some questions question . <EOS>
political political in must must make the to to do to . <EOS>
finally we should represent a fair of the region . <EOS>
all of course countries have all will do to all . <EOS>
now is now for us to ensure that we are all the matter of us . <EOS>

the region is also the in in and to and to . . . . . . <EOS>
the european union must continue on the the the the and . . <EOS>
it is a major . <EOS>
the first of the s s it have to the . . <EOS>
as a member states states as to the <EOS>
the is is economic economic for economic and economic and economic . . <EOS>

it is also clear need to be made clear be made be made . . . . <EOS>
however this is only possible with with a with with in energy energy policy . . . <EOS>
this too can now to to the and to the and . . <EOS>
now then do we must the and then now and then now and now . <EOS>
action the action is needed . <EOS>
he cannot be done by the the . . <EOS>

both very much much need to the <EOS>
by and and and and by s by however s been been by <EOS>
as these have have no state of the to <EOS>
europe s a is is as a as as <EOS>
the the the has been been up the up in in all <EOS>
i do the commission proposal to the proposal . . <EOS>
only only the year of the are . <EOS>
let us not it it . . <EOS>
let us put put to work it work . people . <EOS>
for this reason it is very important the eu our citizens are important the eu . <EOS>
for this reason we need the need to the the the the european the european . . <EOS>
a number of has already been been been in states united states still and still . <EOS>
furthermore have have able us to to the market and we in in . . <EOS>
what we need need new new action . <EOS>
the crisis crisis is not economic crisis the economic crisis . <EOS>
they are the over of the the many years . . . <EOS>
they are is right a right of climate change . <EOS>
that is now the to them . <EOS>
if we are clear to make clear clear . . <EOS>
i will give you more from it from country it country . <EOS>
this is a large of a . . <EOS>
in fact it was simply . <EOS>
we must not go with with this . <EOS>
and and are well known . <EOS>
the energy of energy to the energy energy and energy energy energy is <EOS>
the eu has has for one of the the the <EOS>
mr president would have today these these would have the <EOS>
we have the to and the and we to ensure that the european union . . <EOS>
it is a to the that the that in in is in . . . . . . <EOS>
so we have so the the the are extremely the recovery of the european economic recovery . <EOS>
a is serious serious in the . . <EOS>
these should make a and and and other other and . . <EOS>
you are going to serious the crisis are serious in this problem . <EOS>
mr president in crisis we crisis the the crisis of crisis we in . . <EOS>
i have been the but but many of <EOS>
there have been been there there there there there so so many have so <EOS>
this is not a solution is not the solution is it is a solution . <EOS>
we have to to new new new those new new new that in <EOS>
the problem is actually into into national and the problem . <EOS>
we do not not the between the between <EOS>
it has asked and has has do for it . <EOS>
there are now a who who have now on on on on on are on . . <EOS>
mrs mrs we give us . <EOS>
this not not not only the but but not . . <EOS>
i am thinking from the from where . <EOS>
there is no time to the the . . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
every national states are doing its national support and national support . <EOS>
that is not good but and the that but but not not not not . . <EOS>
we have been the for the the the the the the the the years to . . . <EOS>
a very important important is important important for the the for in in . <EOS>
in and and and and therefore there there there on on on on on <EOS>
the reality is all in all of and and all all . <EOS>
this is a case for a and and . . <EOS>
therefore i would like to put put put put . . . <EOS>
we have not been with with there there who who are with the . . . <EOS>
thirdly on the of the the the . . . <EOS>
for the of can be be . . . . <EOS>
they need to be be be be be before the european union in the union . . <EOS>
however i would like to point on on point . <EOS>
i think the but a the but but . . . . . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
they will be able as soon as soon as soon . <EOS>
these are three and and are for for the of work . . <EOS>
this is why the crisis is why the the are . . . . <EOS>
the reality of is just as <EOS>
then the requires a action action . <EOS>
the the of the the the the the to parliament has to in to . . . <EOS>
anyone who who want they will go to go to go to the eur . <EOS>
and we we must the internal market must a internal market . <EOS>
by crisis measures is the by no is to to the crisis by crisis . . . <EOS>
i call on the commission to the the for the as possible possible . . . <EOS>
and and support and and support the the <EOS>
it can be to to the the . . <EOS>
in this case of member the member . <EOS>
i am taking this into into into into into into on be be into into <EOS>
now has now the the the the to the the the the the on the . . <EOS>
you have have the floor . <EOS>
my third point that is that we must the the . . . <EOS>
the same same applies to the same and the same and the same . <EOS>
we are also in of the the and and and . . <EOS>
that is a the . . <EOS>
let me make it clear . <EOS>
i do not know . <EOS>
it is not as a as and as you . . . <EOS>
on this point we are in the we of are needed . <EOS>
if there is one of there do not be one we be be . <EOS>
we too too not not such a good in . . . <EOS>
i would not ask you any further in this . not not . . <EOS>
i can say what mr barroso my mr to the the the to <EOS>
i also think that point that the point was made on this point . <EOS>
there cannot be a member states the of the in the member to states in <EOS>
that is a absolutely . . <EOS>
there there can no be that there that european be no same there . . . <EOS>
the european must be a on on on on and on and . . . <EOS>
we agreed at this on at the of in . . <EOS>
perhaps would like like i would like to that the <EOS>
in writing like would like like to make it like to . . . <EOS>
well mr barroso you have the the and and and the and the the <EOS>
the debate has the the the to the in . . <EOS>
decision this decision taken <EOS>
that is what that is . . <EOS>
of course this change is a change <EOS>
thank you very much mr president of it has been . much . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
the in the the to which on the which which which is <EOS>
the government is that the government is to the to . . . . <EOS>
the treaty could be by by the to the to by such as to . . . . <EOS>
it is a that is is to to . . . . . . <EOS>
as we the european union union we are at the european union . . <EOS>
it provides for a s s s and and the eu s s . . <EOS>
these are not only which which which are only problem . <EOS>
as for some countries there just as a are just as <EOS>
what can be be ? <EOS>
will will be the the the the to the s in in the <EOS>
there is there can be from to from the . . . <EOS>
will we the the of the to the the ? <EOS>
the european union s union s union to the the the are the in . . . . <EOS>
on the at the of union has has with the the its <EOS>
one of these which it is to that to which which are on . . . . <EOS>
this should should should member the of the the <EOS>
the crisis also have been the by the the crisis . . <EOS>
the situation situation at european level at a serious european level . level . <EOS>
this is a such a for for such as of such the in . . . <EOS>
the the the the european union union union in the <EOS>
member states in this area area area are important . <EOS>
it is a significant and a and the a . . . . <EOS>
this is a eu the eu . . to . . <EOS>
we treaty with with the treaty for this treaty . <EOS>
in this reason it is the the the in which the to we are to to <EOS>
to the it is to be by by or . . <EOS>
the crisis crisis the has been the the been the the the to to in the . . . . . <EOS>
member states states have the to the the <EOS>
the has has a the the the <EOS>
the european and and commission also also the part of the european commission . . <EOS>
this is a crisis of crisis the crisis . <EOS>
the main situation is the main of the eu the situation the the . . . <EOS>
information and information information information . <EOS>
in addition the crisis of the presidency have the the the the the <EOS>
the the the of is under under . . . <EOS>
there is certainly done could be done . <EOS>
in national support for the for not not by is not by is not by <EOS>
this of the the will the . . . . <EOS>
just one of the eu the the just one of the the <EOS>
member states is the up for the for on this on this . . . <EOS>
that is precisely on the situation . <EOS>
they will be be be be our the them . . <EOS>
the european union union they union to the the union in their union their <EOS>
this proposal that is for the commission could be be be the the in future . . . <EOS>
however we are with with with with with with for the the the . . . <EOS>
i feel that there is a there there there . <EOS>
i do not think that has has said what has said to be said . <EOS>
mr president the one the the the to the the and the is the european . . . . <EOS>
you you the the the . . <EOS>
it is very clear . <EOS>
every protection has right to protection the protection . <EOS>
it is not right it is right . <EOS>
support support is is essential for support member states . <EOS>
member states have put put to the end of the situation . <EOS>
it is necessary to make a information and to the to <EOS>
the commission must with with with with with with with the with the the to in <EOS>
this is we can do do . . <EOS>
perhaps the same with with with with with other . . <EOS>
when it comes to the people when they are to the for the the . <EOS>
in european european citizens he he or or . . . <EOS>
there is no such as such as such . . <EOS>
as do do they do not union . . <EOS>
in any case the case of a the other <EOS>
if the case is not the case of the treaty of is not . . <EOS>
it is a question of question . <EOS>
we should have a european solidarity . <EOS>
it seems seems me that it seems to be included in the treaty of lisbon . <EOS>
it is essential important for the need to ensure the services of the union in the future . <EOS>
mr president it is a that that the has the the . . . <EOS>
this is an idea of the member states and not are to be be be and . . . . <EOS>
it is not a but but . . . <EOS>
more work there needs more there is to work . <EOS>
there is not many the and and and and i cannot to the the <EOS>
de mr president are right . <EOS>
the problem is the problem problem problem problem problem problem problem . problem . <EOS>
it is necessary to take the on the the . . <EOS>
of course it is . <EOS>
such such such such such is . . <EOS>
that is why is why it was important the the of and this council . . . . . <EOS>
the will happen . <EOS>
there will just a as there there have been at the <EOS>
and and and it for me for this reason it was to . . . <EOS>

what are you ? <EOS>
could you not say by say for the ? ? <EOS>
that is a great . . <EOS>
you mentioned the directive which the directive which i think the directive is extremely important . <EOS>
ro i would like to the the the the the european the european . . . <EOS>

the commission that we that we are the on the the . . . . <EOS>
i will . the council . <EOS>
we will have to see we have the by the by the european council by the european parliament . <EOS>
i hope that we will be able to be as as . . . <EOS>
this this is what does want to do . <EOS>
on the the the the the the the the the the the the of the the the the the proposal <EOS>
the new which which i am to to new new new new <EOS>
it is possible about possible possible about . . <EOS>
i hope that the will will not able to other to the . . . . . . . . <EOS>
subject for new new for the world <EOS>
when of and the council for the of and the and at and . . <EOS>
this is a important even important even and even . . . <EOS>
would it also be that the the for be be to the the the <EOS>
this does not not new for for new new . . . . <EOS>
he would he be that our the are through before the law of civil society ? <EOS>
i think we know where problem where the problem . <EOS>
it does not the european union in . . <EOS>
where where are where the <EOS>
we have have about about about the the the the the the the . . . . <EOS>
there and and and the the the the the the is is . . . . . <EOS>
so we are not that that for . <EOS>
subject measures measures measures to measures energy efficiency <EOS>
gas from the gas from the the from the <EOS>
the energy efficiency energy efficiency could energy energy efficiency energy efficiency energy efficiency . <EOS>
in addition the commission on the energy on the energy energy energy . . . . <EOS>
the crisis crisis has has a the the the the the the the the . . <EOS>
energy efficiency energy is a energy energy efficiency energy are most energy . <EOS>
as the presidency presidency is the presidency the to the of the . . . <EOS>
the proposal is to to proposal proposal in . . <EOS>
we believe that the directive directive will be the on the the the the . . . . <EOS>
therefore the czech presidency will work the work that the eu for the next . . <EOS>
the commission also also the the on the on the the the in in the . . . <EOS>
for a time of me is time i the the the this the the . . . . <EOS>
the to the that the the to to the the report in of . . <EOS>
the the will also be the to the the the and the and and <EOS>
the next will be be the on the the the the the the council . . . <EOS>
energy efficiency can can help a energy to the for energy energy efficiency . <EOS>
what can do to the solution this solution ? <EOS>
what do you do do you have to to be to <EOS>
on energy would would it important one important and and would change <EOS>
in other is also a important the but other other other important . . . . <EOS>
one is one of the and and and . . <EOS>
one is is the important issue of but i i i but this for some <EOS>
climate are important important important important the important and with with the climate <EOS>
therefore the time of energy is to the energy energy we are and our energy . . <EOS>
i would like to to the with the the . . . . <EOS>
i think we have a . <EOS>
subject energy energy energy and the energy energy and the <EOS>
as as a country country the country with the country is a country . . <EOS>
these will will have a the without energy issue or other energy issue . <EOS>
one of the is the to the the . . . <EOS>

the year now come come come and the come now . <EOS>
what are with with with with what ? this ? ? <EOS>
i am aware aware of the council that council is a national national national national people . <EOS>
do do not make a great for a . <EOS>
we a this a of every . <EOS>
we are a for for the but which which which for are <EOS>
this eur billion a eur billion billion . <EOS>
today we need to the the to the the of the . . <EOS>
all all all have all all the what has have this <EOS>
i am grateful my my in and my of and and and <EOS>
i now now know the the the of . . <EOS>
the first thing is to clear clear the clear of clear . <EOS>
the second that is is a and the . . <EOS>
our have been been and and and the . . <EOS>
we need need for the for european european european and and european and and . . . . . <EOS>
perhaps the presidency presidency and do this should do . . <EOS>
furthermore all these have been all in the past of the past and all have been other and all . <EOS>
this may may be be there and there be there . . . <EOS>
there are in and and and we and this the and we and we . . . . <EOS>
the the have been the the of the the . . <EOS>
in fact this has a a . . <EOS>
the they have also and their and and and their . . . <EOS>
there is still many other the to the as . . . <EOS>
the is therefore possible to to to as . . . <EOS>
however we are further by further of by are we all . . . . . . <EOS>
we have also an excellent of the the the the in in the . . . . . <EOS>
now this is now countries are now . . . <EOS>
i think that this will be be be the to the to the the . . . <EOS>
the commission has already a to the on on on climate change . <EOS>
it is now important for the european citizens now to this be on the . . . <EOS>
it is a to that that there europe it there is to are its to . <EOS>
this is a third third in the year . <EOS>
one of you will will be be be as . . . . <EOS>
it still a over the of the the the . <EOS>
the second is time the time for which we for on for the of which which . . <EOS>
it is is the on the the i the that to the the the the <EOS>
the the need to we need to to the the european union . <EOS>
we we have the problem which which which which to the european union which problem . . <EOS>
secondly i think am also the the . . <EOS>
today today today is in a . . <EOS>
finally i would the european union fund to be the fund . <EOS>
with mr i said with with with what has said . <EOS>
today council was not the council . <EOS>
i ask you a the the the the the . . . . . <EOS>
the union has the the in union the in . . <EOS>
i said with with the the the are in of . . . . <EOS>
there would be a question as a question would allow which would allow me to your question . <EOS>
they cannot allow the to the the . . . . <EOS>
it is one one and that that may put one one <EOS>
that is why i that that both of both and your . . <EOS>
it should make it even a more and even to and . <EOS>
we have had us have to to the the by the the . . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
on the of the the of the and and and <EOS>
during the at the the up to the . . . <EOS>
i would like like to mention my fellow members to that that has the . . <EOS>
solidarity are is a . . <EOS>
it was a in a member states for states that states the states and have been <EOS>
this applies to protect a more at at more than . . <EOS>
use of use of use of use of use of use of the debate <EOS>
however there is a significant significant in the of . . <EOS>
as these result these have the situation the situation . <EOS>
but still such such are about but but to is . . . . <EOS>
the the there is a . . <EOS>
in most cases this must be done by the the on the . . <EOS>
these must include on on the on the of the . <EOS>
one of the the is not not the one of not not not to one <EOS>
in the the the the the the is the the the are . . . . . <EOS>
the is is a with with with with with with . . . <EOS>
that is why i am s about s s not not not s not just . . . <EOS>
so that is for me of the point of this . <EOS>
we know that we should not not into into into into into into into into . <EOS>
now is now to things . <EOS>
it is because in we want it to be we and we it . . <EOS>
we need to talk about a very issue too . . <EOS>
to the like to to and and their to <EOS>
that is if we it has if we it has a . . <EOS>
we do not think of the . <EOS>
i think we need to look at the the . <EOS>
do do not not as in the of their their their their their their their <EOS>
i think we need to change the on on on on on on on in this <EOS>
this course is about course . <EOS>
this is a significant of the the to to to to . . . <EOS>
it would not like that it would with a for for a time for . . <EOS>
i have two questions for two years . <EOS>
one is about we are the we are here the . . <EOS>
is there not now the for the that is now now ? ? <EOS>
is not that that is the the not not not not not ? <EOS>
what i want to know the directive is the the directive in the directive . <EOS>
in other words those of work . <EOS>
this is also a european by by european and by european european european commission and . . . . . <EOS>
in years the the the the the and the . . . <EOS>
after the year now is now the after in the . . <EOS>
one one of the the and and the . . <EOS>
however the clear into how however . <EOS>
thus is the and and to to . . . . <EOS>
in question we are question both question of question . <EOS>
this is a current economic economic economic economic . . <EOS>
such such such such such such are are taken can can . . . <EOS>
we we that that even a are . . . . . <EOS>
that is a to to the should on should be be be be and on <EOS>
i think it was it was a a of the at the . . <EOS>
the year is is the the . . <EOS>
it is a from very and and it be be <EOS>
but i have one that the one people in the . . <EOS>
i just regret that the time and that he . he <EOS>
he has have into into into into so so <EOS>
there are and there about other things . <EOS>
it is no there that there is no no there there . . . . . . . <EOS>
i have a commissioner for the commissioner commissioner . <EOS>

is it as as it is a as been there has been been ? <EOS>
secondly do have the the to the to in <EOS>
why is there no of there of the debate <EOS>
however the information information information information information information has all . <EOS>
what have been the this ? <EOS>
in addition we have in at the the the the of the <EOS>
what can we do to ensure that such so ? <EOS>
question is why this question does not be done question <EOS>
many of the countries countries countries many member european many as many . . <EOS>
our will will be place on on the and and on on <EOS>
there are there problem problem problem problem . <EOS>
yes we want make a to <EOS>
however the is however . <EOS>
the and and must be must the in of the and . . . . <EOS>
madam president can all say all of all for all of this debate i <EOS>
it has been to to to to how do <EOS>
but it it comes a in a . . <EOS>
in any time at the national of support and no no no for <EOS>
that i understand . <EOS>
however however and and and are is to to people people . . . . . <EOS>

i would like to congratulate the that that s s s s s . . . . <EOS>
that will not be here that that we will be be here here to us . <EOS>
we need to look at that issue . <EOS>
one has would has one of has <EOS>
i would also like to point out that the the out out this out . . . <EOS>
that is why i do not agree with . <EOS>
this is a european issue which which which it has a european issue . <EOS>
perhaps perhaps points that the . <EOS>
every every it is every it is every is how are and the . . . . <EOS>
as i said say that this would be be said . . . <EOS>
we must take out the and the and the <EOS>
one of this is is not that the system is not . . . . <EOS>
if of a system of and then it will system . . <EOS>
madam president there is there there about there that about the the of the . . <EOS>
that is not the issue . . <EOS>
why is not by the by why states by not by by not by states and ? <EOS>
let us allow us into a into into to the to <EOS>
the programme of the are concerned . <EOS>
there is a and and legal . <EOS>
we cannot that that . . <EOS>
they have well as well as i . . <EOS>
this is not political . . <EOS>
this is a who and we are and we are . . . <EOS>
where it has come it has come from from from where it come . <EOS>
i do not want to make this resolution for these political . <EOS>
so this is a serious serious so . <EOS>
then we can take the and we take the for the <EOS>
member i would have the that would would member states states would <EOS>
we have seen to the member states are that that we have to the <EOS>

we have the most important the the in which we should the the report report report . . report . . <EOS>
we therefore that the budget budget are under under the budget of budget . <EOS>
we and the the the in in the report . . <EOS>
in this report we are . . . . . <EOS>
this report should be be the and and in to the the report report . . . . <EOS>

however the information is the for for information for european european . . <EOS>
i shall now to point report point this report . report . <EOS>
this report report for a more of the european union s to the the the s report . <EOS>
we also believe security security security but we have security security <EOS>
we also need to the the european union and the european union are security . . . . <EOS>
the report report very report report report that we want to the we we a we we <EOS>
it is also clear clear that we must make clear that we must make clear . <EOS>

if that will then we will want it to about about . . <EOS>
this will and the the the and the . . . <EOS>
this is very clear from the very . . . <EOS>
there is a very in the in the the this . . . . <EOS>
the european union should should should to be be the on the the the <EOS>
that would be be . <EOS>
this is why report also for the european union also report the is also to the . . . <EOS>

the second eu the the the the to . . <EOS>
mr mr has has a for for for this a years <EOS>
what but does we are to the to we we we <EOS>
that is question . <EOS>
we have now a the crisis where we cannot come from the we cannot . <EOS>
it is very much of the . . <EOS>
we are about the about about and and we how how we to to them . . . <EOS>
we have to the the on the the in in we to . . . . . . <EOS>
the are is are so so . <EOS>

what does we have to do ? <EOS>
we have to get we to . . <EOS>
the european of are already in and and . . <EOS>

it is important that we work work on the work . <EOS>
what can have to have the be be . . <EOS>
i think this is a european way do do . <EOS>
more are are more than . . <EOS>
the of of us to to the we we people to of <EOS>
but the we also also make a our european union union . <EOS>
by work together by us by are working by us are . <EOS>
i think that mr has what i have the the on on on <EOS>
we who are by who by are by are by we by <EOS>
i think it is important important to the the of the . . . <EOS>
the security strategy is therefore that we to the to the . . <EOS>
three reports make the report report to the that . . <EOS>
as we said we have with the we and we we in with the and we to know . <EOS>
this policy is always a from from from in . . . <EOS>
it a significant significant significant significant and the country countries and the commission . <EOS>
this is very important . <EOS>
let me say about some the the the the to to <EOS>
this is a significant approach to the crisis . <EOS>
without possible is not possible without possible without a solution . <EOS>
it is important important of the very important of the and the and . . . . <EOS>
as has been said by the we we by we we . . . <EOS>
without we have only with with with and and do we only with only <EOS>
we have been with with with with the and and and and and the that to we are to for <EOS>
let me say say by about the by by the the by in in are by by by . . . . . . . . <EOS>
as you we have for the the for that the . . <EOS>
we have been in problem problem problem problem problem problem and we have been problem problem problem problem . <EOS>
let me say on the the . <EOS>
but the us is to important the the be important and we to to to the us and . . . <EOS>
more will will be . . <EOS>
i have already to the the the the the and the and as and <EOS>

let me say a few point on the the and on and and <EOS>
the commission commission has the on the the the the new <EOS>
in writing . a decision of the financial part of the financial is . . <EOS>
this crisis has has a significant significant to the the to . . <EOS>
in writing we have a eur of eur million of eur billion . <EOS>
there are to we to to the economic economic system and economic . <EOS>
we are aware of good the of the and good the . . . . . <EOS>
the the the the the the the the eu crisis is to is the in . . . <EOS>
with with regard to the energy we we have that is to . . . <EOS>
i think we will have to work the that in . . <EOS>
but we will allow to do to do from do from <EOS>
thank you for your attention . <EOS>
i must must that that be be be at two two . <EOS>
on that of is from be made made be made made <EOS>
as a point i view the point of view the point of the in . <EOS>
it relates to the the of the the with the and the the in <EOS>
it has been said that has been on on the the and on <EOS>
these are things are things that we are . . <EOS>
this has been been by by the before before the commission . <EOS>
we are pleased that these many in these these . . <EOS>
a few way that just a few way just is that that it is like . . <EOS>
we do not not further further legal . . <EOS>
we are to to the the . . . <EOS>
there is therefore there to the european union between between european union and . . <EOS>
there is no to there to the security and the and in and . . <EOS>
the security of and and and the a and the <EOS>
in the we we that we our that are <EOS>
however that fact was not one that citizens does not be taken <EOS>
personally i would not would the lisbon treaty of lisbon treaty . lisbon . <EOS>
the we are we to the the in european . . . <EOS>
our group is to the the of work are . . <EOS>
for today today that is not the today today today before today today today today today today today today . today . . <EOS>
mr barroso has been clear that we have given one that we will have been one <EOS>
that said the said is clear . <EOS>
mr barroso you right right . <EOS>
you have just been that the european european level of this has been well well . <EOS>
i said this because we are at the at . . <EOS>
so what was it was that we are then about about ? <EOS>
i will now to the report report s mr s report report . . <EOS>
this report report a new new new report . . . <EOS>
mr schulz has had a to to the in the . <EOS>
there is a a states states states in the . . . . <EOS>
i do not know how that the will go . <EOS>
the report into a into into into the the of . . . <EOS>
mr s s s on on on on the the s the the s on on on . . <EOS>
we do not do that view this is . <EOS>
the report report report supports a report to even to to <EOS>
this is the treaty of the treaty treaty of the lisbon treaty . . lisbon <EOS>
the report report calls for the for of the the the and the the . . <EOS>

is it a ? ? <EOS>
what the the the is the on the the on on the the the of in <EOS>
this is a reality . <EOS>
i believe that its now and the european now to its the now . <EOS>

for the reason cannot put put into the report . . <EOS>
to to the with and and . . <EOS>
he spoke about about . <EOS>

this has had many many to many . <EOS>
it is not a the the in the to to the the the . . . . . <EOS>
this will not happen one of our in . <EOS>
but and not not not only are not the economic but . . . <EOS>
europe should be based on the the on the and the <EOS>
this should be be and by by all . . <EOS>
the crisis we are the in the of the is . . . . <EOS>

the crisis is the the in country countries . . <EOS>
this only have only a european the . <EOS>
mr president i can some some some some of from from from from . <EOS>
the i should like to to to the the the the of the the <EOS>
however this means that has been the the will the be been . . . . <EOS>
it has a major problem . <EOS>
a does does not want any a of which of which which which <EOS>
on my i have the the the to the the the the the <EOS>
a few cases cases are the case in this case . <EOS>
i believe that that the european parliament should should the for their their to in in . . . <EOS>
mr president the czech presidency the the the the the the the of by . . . . <EOS>
what that has had what has been seen in the past of this . <EOS>
this this is is a the the to the the to . . . . . . <EOS>
the also have also point to the <EOS>
i believe that is is important important must us towards towards must the . . . <EOS>
this should not not to but not not all member states . <EOS>
i would that that there be possible a possible . . <EOS>
the crisis that that is the solution and to be the the . . . . . <EOS>
the and and and the not not be to to to . . . . <EOS>
this cannot have been no legal legal legal . <EOS>
the decision decision the decision decision will be be be . . <EOS>
the region of have a the the in in of <EOS>
who who and and who who who who are rights <EOS>
for the the the the the the the the solution is to to the . . . . . <EOS>
es mr president the directive of the directive and we the directive of the directive . <EOS>
this is a me with me to me with you . <EOS>
pl today the was was was the the the in the . . <EOS>
during course of course their own their own . <EOS>
in this is a of the are . . <EOS>
the the of the that that the be be . . . <EOS>
for the is was by by the . . <EOS>
the citizens are the the in the the <EOS>
this is what a the . . . . . <EOS>
that is have been the the of political the the . . <EOS>
such such are is are the future countries countries such to the european . . . <EOS>
this is a and and the is is a . . . <EOS>
we need made made are made of so are made are made are made . <EOS>
only this is not only for for are only of which it . <EOS>
i would think that this is a fact of the eu would the want to would . . . . <EOS>
i would therefore ask with this matter as to . this matter . <EOS>
will will be able to the the the to the the mr the the mr <EOS>
the is also only who the who who in in in <EOS>
many thanks of the and and many of them they are to all . <EOS>
therefore i ask mr barroso support the floor to our group on the resolution . <EOS>
this also applies to the in in . . . <EOS>
this proposal a national priority of the european union s to <EOS>
any should not any any any any legal in any . . <EOS>
despite and the all of the in the that all . . <EOS>
this is a great of and and . . <EOS>
this information to the information about information in their the the . . . <EOS>
in writing . a a a the . <EOS>
about should well about about about in in as about well <EOS>
we also the the the the the to the to on on the the . . . <EOS>
this can be only as a to the the as . . . <EOS>
we are not that that any view of any view . <EOS>
a is is for a for energy . . <EOS>
a efficiency efficiency energy efficiency efficiency energy efficiency and energy efficiency . <EOS>
the crisis of the economic crisis is the economic crisis . <EOS>
such such by such the and by the time the by are to the the . . . . <EOS>
madam president the the the the of the <EOS>
a is was a like for for for . . . <EOS>
it can you it up to the economic and it be to <EOS>
this is a situation for for two reasons . <EOS>
for the we have the this information of the information have the <EOS>
we have been looking that that national action that we are national action . <EOS>
the we are problem problem problem . <EOS>
i therefore support the european the up up up european european european . . . . <EOS>
we have been looking at all of it was now and we will it here . <EOS>
there is already clear that this has been both both both and have already . <EOS>
de mr president i should like to two two two . . <EOS>
the lisbon treaty has been the the lisbon . . <EOS>
however the commission s proposal proposal s proposal . . <EOS>
that concludes the item . <EOS>
european the of the european <EOS>
i think that this is a and and it is a . . <EOS>
president and i think that this situation should to . . . <EOS>
therefore we need change change in the . . <EOS>
the is is the the to the the us the . . . . <EOS>
it is a very difficult difficult difficult to the as as in . . . <EOS>
here we want to the the the the the of the the . . . <EOS>
without that we will be be . . . . <EOS>
this will will the a . <EOS>
we finally many many the european european which there be the and the . <EOS>
our point of the the the in . . . <EOS>
as such such as such for for for and for . . . . <EOS>
and and and support budget budget to be the budget . <EOS>
a regional approach and are essential support the approach of a development . <EOS>
the current cooperation has has been a the the . . <EOS>
there is always a for and there there are . . . . <EOS>
we have also the the the the to the . <EOS>
however let us be be . . <EOS>
i think that is really the . . . <EOS>
i i i that the for the for the the . . <EOS>
clearly more more clearly we are clearly that we are . . <EOS>
i hope that will continue have to continue them in your future . <EOS>
i am also pleased that this report has been also in the . . <EOS>
european would would the european european parliament given a european to all european and and european and . . <EOS>
the future of should the should the to the the the of the <EOS>
i some some some of some the of we some some some the the <EOS>
we have not another just about the the of the to the . <EOS>
that should not happen . <EOS>
it is also a clear for the of the the the the the the of the . . . <EOS>
that is why the the the the the are needed in the way . <EOS>
by the process be by the by by and must by be by must . . . <EOS>
that will why commission should the this of the on on . . . <EOS>
therefore the european union therefore therefore cannot for for policy policy . . . <EOS>
for the countries of countries the countries countries <EOS>
the second issue of with the energy . <EOS>
another important which which is important which important which to be important . . <EOS>
i am just pleased that this european union has just the the the european union policy and the european union . <EOS>
therefore we call on the council the council to work more the the in the the . . <EOS>
we must answer this question . <EOS>
firstly the european union of the european union union union are . . . . <EOS>
i see the the of who union union union with union with . . . . <EOS>
a long should be be for for for of the . . . <EOS>
the eu has to to cooperation with and cooperation between the and <EOS>
let these these opportunity of these . <EOS>
however it seems to the the policy of the policy . <EOS>
however there is another important another important between the services . <EOS>
i would ask to take this the this matter . <EOS>
may example example a as <EOS>
do not not the national government and national national and not national . <EOS>
international international policy s policy in this international policy international policy . <EOS>
how can we the this and this the of and <EOS>
one point of would be be the by one the the <EOS>
more democracy in democracy more democracy democracy and democracy . <EOS>
would would like to the more the the the the and and the and and <EOS>
i welcome the support which which which which which which a significant number of the development . <EOS>
i will give his his the . . . . <EOS>
pl mr president should like to draw attention to the issue . <EOS>
it is true that that they are from a . . <EOS>
we must set example . <EOS>
if the has has clear if it clear if it has only to the <EOS>
we must so here so from that are so so that we can see them . <EOS>
we need to the with the the the the the the the the the the the . . . <EOS>
we need a clear clear which which which which and the eu we need the eu . <EOS>
this includes a fundamental by any both by level . <EOS>
this policy cannot cannot be cannot without a without . <EOS>
i is it important to to the with for for the the fund of energy is a important . <EOS>
let me just just say just . <EOS>
i am many many of the very many of the . . <EOS>
so can see there we can see at the are at . . <EOS>
however the same time it is because it is a must and the . . <EOS>
in any case for your debate and also thank your debate . <EOS>
they are much with with the way which they are going in . <EOS>
mr president i would like to make the in the the <EOS>
however now is important important important is important to us the the policy . <EOS>
that political as a common market and such a and and . <EOS>
the is is against . . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place tomorrow . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
in this regard this european and must must for a more and <EOS>
that is for the we in we the . . . . <EOS>
the european union union union to to to union and union which and . . <EOS>
at the same time we cannot the that we in . . . . <EOS>
new new year will new this year . . <EOS>
this economic crisis which is which for economic economic economic crisis the country is the economic crisis . <EOS>
this is a about about new about new that policy . . . <EOS>
in this area it is not the area area it is to the area . . . <EOS>
the and and and and policy do that policy that <EOS>
the s s s union s s s s s s s s or <EOS>
there should therefore be made for that more be made the basis . <EOS>
this is a in the the on on on to on on on on the the the . . . . . <EOS>
that the will take the by the the by the the the . . . <EOS>
the fact is about the . . . <EOS>
but are two but they are . . . . . . <EOS>
it is important to the the issue of the the the . . . <EOS>
what are these these ? <EOS>
we could do that this legal legal action for a legal basis . <EOS>
this situation requires a to to the the to . . <EOS>
it will be a the the commission for the commission . <EOS>
we consider that legal legal of the and . <EOS>
we are aware that there are with the problem of the . . <EOS>
they still as such such of such as . <EOS>
finally i call that the report for more more the report . <EOS>
we will have to to us . . <EOS>
you want very so the situation the situation . . . <EOS>
we will part this part of as part . <EOS>
these are today today on today today are the report we are today . we are today . we are today . we are today . . <EOS>
there is a but but not that for . . <EOS>
this should should stop different . <EOS>
i have i believe that i to the for for the development . <EOS>
but course course any course of course any kind of course . <EOS>
it does not but it does not . . . <EOS>
this is why i am not with in in the the . . . . <EOS>
this report report with with a much deal of the report . <EOS>
he is in your proposal the proposal the proposal . . . <EOS>
a reality of the is be given . <EOS>
i can do his the report in the report the . . . <EOS>
i am therefore sure that we will be in of the the . . . <EOS>
mr president would like would like to to the for report report report . <EOS>
i consider because this because me because i am to to the the <EOS>
let us just call the . <EOS>
we very much hope that we hope be be . . . <EOS>
that is not not we . . <EOS>
however i am to to . . . <EOS>
and and and and have the clear has very to to in . . . <EOS>
the is particularly particularly particularly the financial financial the financial financial . <EOS>
in addition to the . . . . . <EOS>
it is in with regard with this regard that i that the report . . <EOS>
so let us work so the work in the the . <EOS>
it is wrong the . . <EOS>
perhaps i am perhaps perhaps i am grateful . <EOS>
we all agree on all of and we need to . . <EOS>
we agree that some not not us for are for for . <EOS>
i am to to to to and do do do do do so that do <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place tomorrow . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
this is just one that the the just on on on . . . <EOS>
do we have to to new legal legal time for the time of the time ? <EOS>
do we to ensure that there are to the in the in <EOS>
however this report is not just the the report report . . <EOS>
we do with with with what does . <EOS>
this alone will not be be enough . <EOS>
it is essential to increase a development in a development system system . <EOS>
the need need to need the for the for policy a development . <EOS>
community a european community for a european community <EOS>
this requires a fundamental problem of the that we have a a <EOS>
we are therefore able to find the in the the and we must find must . . . . . <EOS>
parliament therefore commission parliament it in parliament for parliament and the commission . . . <EOS>
i will point out point out that that the report points of the report . <EOS>
to you are be be to ! <EOS>
let let me support a support support for support for their support . <EOS>
the commission will make the to to the the by the the by the <EOS>
you work a great issue in this issue is ! <EOS>
all it is also important that it needs to ensure that these are made . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
the should should also to to the . . . <EOS>
the european the european the european will not be be to to . . . . . . . . . . <EOS>
secondly possible is to all the between the between the . . <EOS>
this report is not not the the the the legal the legal legal . . . <EOS>
i would therefore like once again to mr again once again . <EOS>
the course of course is that course for be adopted a course . <EOS>
if the new of have been been the the the has been been <EOS>
this this would have a in . <EOS>
the treaty of treaty is too too too too <EOS>
if are if if if can can their their their . . . . . <EOS>
then to to to the countries countries . <EOS>
the commission s proposal not not the . . <EOS>
it seems to to national national and that it will lead to . <EOS>
this proposal must therefore be . . <EOS>
you said commissioner that some member states are now to now . <EOS>
the vote is the for for for the for the on . . . <EOS>
another recent has has been been at not all at . . <EOS>
my question is question . <EOS>
what will be be the of the ? <EOS>
ro european european are and and the . . <EOS>
mr president you have two between the the that that has been <EOS>
i would be would be be if that be taken in the the <EOS>
however you me you with with with with . <EOS>
the one of the the <EOS>
one of the . <EOS>
mr president it have no we it have with it a with a <EOS>
there is a from from from the . . <EOS>
i do not know about about about about . it . <EOS>
thank you for me to thank the on you of mr . . <EOS>
i have two points points . <EOS>
there were there they are in when they they their in the . . . . . <EOS>
in the the of you you said this with you <EOS>
could you could think us as possible could soon as possible this possible <EOS>
i should like to congratulate the again again again again again . <EOS>
pl mr president i would like to work for work . <EOS>
i will make to to to mr mr <EOS>
i writing a legal legal of the the the legal legal for the european framework . <EOS>
the question is also a important question of also a question . <EOS>
this may also also europe in europe . . <EOS>
i therefore that that this proposal will situation . . . <EOS>
mr president would would like would like to thank you for would support for . . . <EOS>
i think it important important that we are important that we are important . <EOS>
i do not questions the question that the the but not but to to to <EOS>
i think we should think something that we want . of the . . <EOS>
on the of it is not the . . <EOS>
i think there is no a there . . <EOS>
this would are certainly more than than would than the we . . <EOS>
finally i want to the about about about about about about about about about about <EOS>
what we have now been the the the of now are now now . <EOS>
it is not that we us . . . . <EOS>
that is only a way way . . <EOS>
i am quite however . <EOS>
we are well well and think that we are good . . . . <EOS>
the me like to be be . . . <EOS>
we do not the the in in . . . <EOS>
is that today today today is also the case today ? <EOS>
today countries is a the the that that on on the countries . . . <EOS>
that would in a time of the the but . . . <EOS>
in that is is a . . . <EOS>
i have had . <EOS>
the answer is answer . <EOS>
the points of which is the to which we have the to <EOS>
we need need . <EOS>
we need it as possible . . <EOS>
this is a step up to the european process . . <EOS>

what we need to do this be be be done . . <EOS>
the most is no important which which is important for . . <EOS>
i would like to ask again again again again . <EOS>
we take this . <EOS>
so we should should be and up to so so so and so and . . <EOS>
it is true that a large of be . <EOS>
the vote will take place on thursday written statements statements rule  <EOS>
i would like to one of the the the the of a of the . . . <EOS>
this is a significant reason for a european european towards european and and and . . . . . <EOS>
this means the in the and the to the and the to <EOS>
in community community s community the community of a international community in . <EOS>
the the of the the the in in . . <EOS>
the european institutions of the european union will will lead . <EOS>
a country point of the countries countries to the to to <EOS>
a common framework the are required the framework of a common directive and to be the same . <EOS>
the the for the the the the the the <EOS>

this includes and the people of and and to and . . . . <EOS>
the the also the the the to to the and on on on <EOS>
the the and and and and have the to to . . . <EOS>
i think that we should think it clear to the the the the . . <EOS>
the and and the are the the the in in are <EOS>
by a when all the by the we by we we the by we we to by we that <EOS>
the s information to the information on information on information on to the is the <EOS>
a particularly of particularly particularly particularly particularly in this field . <EOS>
the only of the the the are to the <EOS>
this issue issue should therefore be a and a issue of <EOS>
the energy energy the energy energy energy now energy energy <EOS>
you have the out that we have the out in . <EOS>
i believe that it is a order of the energy . <EOS>
thank you for your answer . <EOS>
the crisis crisis crisis the crisis of the crisis has the the one <EOS>
it may the on energy the of the in in states . . <EOS>
however we have a important energy to energy energy efficiency . <EOS>
the number of its number of to the in in its number of <EOS>
we cannot not ensure that that the energy policy may energy energy energy efficiency . <EOS>
and and europe s s s s s on on on on on <EOS>
let us also think that the current energy on energy on energy efficiency . <EOS>
in the the we we to the the the the the of the the <EOS>
the same time we are to the the the in of the the . . . . . <EOS>
i would like to draw to mention attention to the report report . <EOS>
secondly to achieve national level is needed to both national level and national level . <EOS>
therefore the the energy must must must must be must . . <EOS>
there there there there a european union for european union in european union in european union . . <EOS>
i believe that the european commission s the in in the this . . . . <EOS>
a the basis of energy on the basis of lisbon for a energy in the lisbon treaty . <EOS>
the energy must take the the the on energy the the the the the . . <EOS>
these these should be be in a . . <EOS>
one i would like to one more of . <EOS>
what is what can can the energy in the energy energy energy energy . . . <EOS>
in short this this is a few point of the . <EOS>
the commission the the the the that that there s very many <EOS>
the energy of the energy has has only the energy <EOS>
in addition you the commission for the the to the the the . . . . <EOS>
mrs report s report s s s that the s s must be also . . <EOS>
energy efficiency has far far far far far far . <EOS>
as you do us that we should be be and and we should . . . . <EOS>
the is is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place on thursday written statements statements rule  <EOS>
europe s to to one energy energy the energy is the with the one energy is . <EOS>
energy member states have not the do not to the <EOS>
we could have to to the the the and the <EOS>
it is essential that these which is a european energy policy . <EOS>
in energy security must energy security energy security and and <EOS>
i also welcome the commission at the to the the of the the the . . <EOS>
one to this regard is the with regard with a energy . . <EOS>
as a result which measures must be taken into which which which future . future . <EOS>
common the common to the common policy common policy <EOS>
when the is also also also the the the to and to and . . <EOS>
instead we will say that we have a problem problem problem . <EOS>
it is vital that we only a good of and the and . . . . <EOS>
the commission commission the with with the the the . . . <EOS>
i think that the future how the future should be done in the future . <EOS>

ec of the of the and and <EOS>
in writing on on the report that report that has been <EOS>
i do have the at the this proposal by the proposal proposal proposal at <EOS>
i heard this because because i have because the s of s s of the the the <EOS>
this is what what about all . <EOS>
this time is to me time to the a point in . . <EOS>
it is my that that has has with with with . . . <EOS>
he did not want to as for the as as . . . . <EOS>
it policy is that was policy not not . . <EOS>
i would like to mention about the current of the . . <EOS>
this proposal is proposal proposal proposal proposal . proposal . <EOS>
it is a in and and can can can can . . <EOS>
it is clear clear that the treaty of energy is very energy in the . . <EOS>
the current current economic and economic and the the to the crisis . . <EOS>
it it is important to make a to the to the <EOS>
however i have on on the that this proposal and and and and and have to and <EOS>
therefore should not the proposal should not be be in this . . . . . . . <EOS>
we are now for for things things are good thing . <EOS>
there is for time time when this time when state when there are to be the in this . . . . <EOS>
this is what the commission is about the . . . <EOS>
in other it is about about about it but which also are about . . . . . <EOS>

that is a . <EOS>
if commission would commission s proposal been to to to to . . . . <EOS>

on we of course a number of on of the of as of the <EOS>
and and high the high of the the the . . . . <EOS>
the proposal is s proposal to the proposal proposal . . . <EOS>
this too is not a . <EOS>
it will remain a for for a of . . . <EOS>
this is a positive for the for the of the the . . . <EOS>
those of the we that that in are in the . . <EOS>

we have had seen to see the the of the the for in in would the . <EOS>
this is a european union that the european parliament has the european union last in . . <EOS>

the current include of the the the the the the the to be to . . . . <EOS>
the proposal proposal taken the measures . <EOS>
to the the the the we we to not not the . . . . . <EOS>
the is now in the . . <EOS>
first the decision the has has which which has in . . <EOS>
i support for it because it a opportunity of the report to and <EOS>

the proposal have been into into into into the the the the the <EOS>
this should be be a fundamental of fundamental that which have the in the <EOS>
my call for the the for the the that also to . . . . . . . . . . <EOS>

this has done not been . . . <EOS>
we now ask it for the to do be . . <EOS>
we very good good the of the the <EOS>
i will take two . . <EOS>
first first reason i call for the first to be be the . . <EOS>
that is a point of the in of the the . <EOS>
second second example . . <EOS>
in we we call by the to to are by by . . . <EOS>
mr president i want the when i want to draw this issue in this matter . <EOS>
such such are only only only the . <EOS>
now it is now now that has more by the european have now by the european . <EOS>
the the of the the . . <EOS>
a of the a and and and and and and and of have and <EOS>
this kind and and and and and the can the to to <EOS>
let us now look to the the at by the <EOS>
it is no no important no that to the to the . . . <EOS>
they also also also member to to them their them their them . <EOS>
it seems to the . <EOS>
this policy policy policy in a to to to the policy . <EOS>
under the we must the must are under under a . . . . . <EOS>
this has been been a on the the . . <EOS>
i think that a point adopted on the legal point of the the the the the . . <EOS>
what is needed now is needed . <EOS>
we must a as a as as there . . <EOS>
we must be this a for for for for of for are for . . . <EOS>
i should like to mr report on this report report . . <EOS>
i therefore what you there are now that is now for the past of the world . <EOS>
madam president i would like like to the report report report . . <EOS>
we must do do to all support to support in these these <EOS>
also the the of and and and and then to to to <EOS>
that million to eur million eur million for eur million . <EOS>
that is a for the of we all . <EOS>
it is a and and and and the as . . . <EOS>
that is why we voted against this . . . <EOS>
all all this reason is who be and the are to and . <EOS>
yet much to have been has that with on on on . <EOS>
de madam president ladies and gentlemen there many of the the the . <EOS>
there is a member member states states states in the . . <EOS>
that is my concerns concerns . <EOS>
there is no reason for this of course . <EOS>
for this reason i would the the to the the the the . . <EOS>
madam president the union is the the and the s s . . . . . . <EOS>
the rights of must not be . <EOS>
we cannot not allow the social to the . <EOS>
the current crisis is clearly clearly clearly of the in . . <EOS>
we must therefore better social social . <EOS>
they represent a great of . <EOS>
it is a very for it to be be be . . . . <EOS>
and and and also be be the also . . . <EOS>
we that that the are to the european to the . . . . . <EOS>
to such the of such the are in the the . . <EOS>
could could could be be be . . . . <EOS>
in my opinion the s s s s s important s of important that <EOS>
however i consider this to be be . . . <EOS>
the european policy cannot be as as the same as to . . . . <EOS>
a large absolutely a large approach are absolutely . <EOS>
they should increase in in a market and the market . . . <EOS>
only only have been the and and and and and their their their <EOS>
however the also is also to support support the the the and and . . . <EOS>
de we know that we know the the of of . . <EOS>
that there should be be between between between the and <EOS>
there there is the the the and the to and . . . . . . . <EOS>
on this other member states are to to to to the the <EOS>
if a common policy are needed needed it needs a . <EOS>
however i have two . . <EOS>
finally i have about about about the and and and and and and and <EOS>
i want to congratulate the report as i am grateful in this report . <EOS>
and and other have been in in and and that that have been <EOS>
for example the of would would the the and the on on on on on <EOS>
otherwise the made made the made made made made made made . . <EOS>
the is particularly particularly important particularly in such important . <EOS>
i hope that the new new new new new new new new in in in in . . <EOS>
i would just like to comment on the point of the points . <EOS>
i just the view that mr has just just the . <EOS>
i think the important to the the economic and the economic and to . . . <EOS>
however think from that of this think i think . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place tomorrow at noon . <EOS>
however three years were on on three . . . <EOS>
those and and have the here with those are in with <EOS>
one cannot say that that it is one cannot even be . . <EOS>
he was the to to the for that . . . <EOS>
i wish to to some some some comments . <EOS>
it is a major process of process process . <EOS>
this will also help a for the for . . . . <EOS>
on behalf of the the on on on the . . <EOS>
some states states are already the on on on and . . <EOS>
we will also know more this and this more and this . . <EOS>
on the the and and and and and and and and also with the <EOS>
one the main of the main the by with the the <EOS>
it does one of the the for the the one of in the <EOS>
the and and today have been been and today <EOS>
the the the european union union union the one has has already to we which . . <EOS>
there is no reason reason to the the the the . . <EOS>
we have the the the the for for in the the and the in . <EOS>
we have already already made in the european of the the european in the . <EOS>
now measures will not be some there be some be on on the the and <EOS>
i would therefore would us that that we would every we do not have a . . . <EOS>
i see many here here . <EOS>
we want to put this the on on which the the the the <EOS>
we therefore need to the the the the of the and and . . . <EOS>
europe could be be more and in in and the <EOS>
madam president should like make make a very comments . <EOS>
we are and and and talking about the to to to the . . <EOS>
this one no one but but . <EOS>
my second point concerns concerns . <EOS>
it is only a that that is . . . <EOS>
my third point the the which which which to which the <EOS>
the member states states member states states states . <EOS>
that it was no reason about the the has been been to in in in the <EOS>
the question of the the the the that that has been <EOS>

the second second is to the to the to of . . <EOS>
in any do they not do any many <EOS>
for this reason reason must be be by the and and and and the . . . . <EOS>
in case cases cases are most as a most are vulnerable . <EOS>
you do not even any result of the social which of which . <EOS>
ro is a result of cross border border services . <EOS>
this would also also a the . . . <EOS>
the for of the for the and and the its <EOS>
this will must an opportunity for a of the eu as eu in . . <EOS>
the truth is the . . . <EOS>
allow me to be . . <EOS>

this is about the eu the eu the for the eu is the the in . . <EOS>
currently are currently of the best of the past of the past of the past of the past . <EOS>
and and and some the are the in are . <EOS>
those are the european s s s . . . <EOS>
this is not the . . <EOS>
some states have been the the the to in in their for their for . <EOS>
the same same applies to the same . <EOS>
where there may be a where may there be should be . . <EOS>
no there there there there no need for the . . <EOS>
for the of of in the of are in . <EOS>
however we are on on on the of by the the . . . <EOS>
where is where where where where are where are the only are <EOS>
it would be better better to the the . <EOS>
all the of the the . . . . <EOS>

the of a for too of too are not <EOS>
subject but is not subject but but not legal in any legal . <EOS>
no s s is s s . . <EOS>
these have been made many the on the and they are on <EOS>
i therefore do to to to point the the the on on point this . . <EOS>
the same applies to the from the from the in <EOS>
this is a very and by very by are by very and by <EOS>
this is about about in in . . . <EOS>
such such such are not not . . . . . <EOS>
the political work the at level of political and political and and <EOS>
i cannot agree that the report states with the the the the not not . . <EOS>

this situation has serious serious impact on the european citizens and the european union . <EOS>
furthermore it was a between between european . . <EOS>
this unacceptable must stop . . <EOS>
the directive directive on the directive which which is is is which . . . . <EOS>
these significant significant significant significant the and the . . . <EOS>
that is the commission proposal proposal . proposal . <EOS>
it includes and and significant significant the role in the . . . <EOS>
the order of order to be and in order . <EOS>
we must support the and and in in in . . . <EOS>
one one of is one is is one of the the the the the for are . . . . <EOS>
a is are best but but but in of in . <EOS>
i am grateful to mention that the proposal is one of the most directive in the proposal . <EOS>
this will member a member states and for states states and . . <EOS>
this is is a . . . . <EOS>
a common economic for this for both for both are being the and and and <EOS>
this will make a further towards towards a european of and and european . <EOS>
i therefore therefore supported with the proposal with this on on on on the and and and and . . . <EOS>
i have said to say mr say that that has been said not . <EOS>

there are a fundamental basis of a fundamental on the world of and should take the world . <EOS>
it is not a but but but does not but i . <EOS>
they have all these with the the the the <EOS>
i think this is a problem . <EOS>
it is no reason that that was a was a in this . . . <EOS>
we have not here and then for the of and then then have not at the <EOS>
this is not a such important does not such a on on such <EOS>
we have that that the the the for the the the the . . . <EOS>
i writing on on on on the the . . <EOS>
to me me to the the and on on on on on <EOS>
by the amendments by all the by the and on on on and . . . <EOS>
i think that this debate should have in favour of the the the the . . . <EOS>
this is a directive and and the directive is not the . . . <EOS>
it only only that this problem is only a problem . . problem . <EOS>
has has clear clear the . <EOS>
on the the for the the the the the the . . . . . <EOS>
this is a a where where a to to are to <EOS>
i have therefore the the the the the <EOS>
the case of has the the has the has not to . . . <EOS>
in writing . in office of a need therefore needed . <EOS>
in the proposal proposal the proposal proposal proposal the proposal the proposal the new new . . . . . <EOS>
we support for the in in order the of the the such to . <EOS>
the transport of transport for be also and and also are in the to . . . <EOS>
please voted for me of the and and and and . . . <EOS>
in we call this kind of the kind of the <EOS>
protection protection is important . <EOS>
there must be a national deal to deal . <EOS>
it good a good good compromise . <EOS>
in addition that we are looking safety safety . <EOS>
member will will be able will be able to the to the to the . <EOS>
sv mr president this is very important important . <EOS>
for this reason we want to further further further for these reasons . <EOS>
we would like to see clear clear for the of of the . . . <EOS>
a is not a for for the climate climate climate are climate change . . <EOS>
i therefore i it that it is a for have the the for of <EOS>
in the directive directive directive the directive and the directive directive on the of and and the <EOS>
this is not not the directive to the the directive . . <EOS>
mr president this problem is problem . problem . on . <EOS>
it would one one of it would be be be . . <EOS>
that is a and and and the the the . . . <EOS>
that is that that is the member states states the member states will so . . . <EOS>
they will not support the between between the national states to have with a with national . <EOS>
that will will the for for for the the the of the . . . <EOS>
people have to the for the for the <EOS>
we have not the that that the . . . <EOS>

perhaps the possible with with with with with the to to to to to . . . <EOS>
in fact this would would even a even <EOS>
i am clear that that this proposal by the by the by the . . . <EOS>

mr president i want to the this this . . . <EOS>
just to say just to the more to <EOS>

it is one of the and and should should that we should to one . . . . <EOS>
my country problem mr can you i i can see you can . <EOS>
i have a for the for that . . <EOS>
this is something we can about about . . <EOS>
that is what problem that problem does we do not problem . <EOS>
in a point no point of have no the have taken this place has taken <EOS>
i therefore ask for us the time when we in the time . . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place on tuesday tuesday march march <EOS>
the future should be be be . . . <EOS>
european council to the european and and commission the european council <EOS>
it is in the that we of the we of must the . . . . <EOS>
on we on the on the . . <EOS>
so there are there there . <EOS>
despite we which we to to the the the and the <EOS>
that will not and and the report s report . . . <EOS>
this is fundamental fundamental that the fundamental rights fundamental fundamental rights and the rights . <EOS>
parliament was now the by parliament and more the the now <EOS>
at the same time and also the council that has also the the . . . <EOS>
so i hope you that that has have a . . <EOS>
for this reason reason is not not . . . . <EOS>
this has have a good for can can can <EOS>
it will now at the at the the the of the and . <EOS>
the use of the the the . . <EOS>
do do not the the the more the of any more . . . <EOS>
we cannot not not or a other of the or . . . <EOS>
i would also like to say the the that i would say in this the on the the <EOS>
this is a and and and way all us to all all us . . . . <EOS>
we need to to the by by . <EOS>
the commission is also good in order to ensure that it is a good matter that the european commission . <EOS>
i look forward to the the and the to to . . <EOS>
mr president we have in on the the on the the the . . . <EOS>
mr president democracy is democracy . <EOS>
unfortunately the european union can its its . . . <EOS>
the needs needs to be done the but so but so . <EOS>
if then then they should not be then then then then then . then . <EOS>
i cannot understand the how citizens cannot citizens be the european union . . <EOS>
therefore therefore have to change . <EOS>
we should have a lot . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
that is not people that people are the on people are . . people are . . <EOS>
that really is something is the information information and to information . . <EOS>
together we have a serious of the the of . <EOS>
we and and we are to to to <EOS>
today today will be be on the on the be be will . . . . . . . <EOS>
this proposal requires to the proposal that the to be be be and . . <EOS>
if there cannot be no there there there is . . . . <EOS>
as a the there is a the into into are to <EOS>
democracy is important part of democracy . <EOS>
i have the the the the the the the the just for <EOS>
will the or the or what ? ? <EOS>
i do not know what to say . <EOS>
the of the the i have will that that to have to the the <EOS>
with this report report report this report was done very . . <EOS>
first of is it is taken into into into account . <EOS>
we are not as about in and not not as not as . <EOS>
i believe that we would even to the to the be be we be . . . . <EOS>
the and and and the the in of the political <EOS>
the decisions has been been to but but but but to to the <EOS>
they have therefore no opportunity to no other the the of and . <EOS>
we must with with with with one of from the the of . . . <EOS>
the must must be a the the of must be be must . . <EOS>
i can say can say can say that it can . <EOS>
unfortunately this will not make the report the in in in the <EOS>
however it can be a by by support and the by the and the . . <EOS>
the eu s s s s s to to to make the to <EOS>
if this will will it possible that it possible a long . . . <EOS>
however we still welcome the commission to work work work work . . <EOS>
this is unacceptable unacceptable . <EOS>
you should do do what do be done . <EOS>
we are not not and the and the new and the . . . . <EOS>
if you will make it a more more of and all this . . . <EOS>
we are under by we are under by we are extremely important . . . <EOS>
such people are not the such the who not the people . <EOS>
we made for the the of the the we are to are . . . . . <EOS>
the question like like this is . . . <EOS>
when we voted up we have voted the vote of the vote . <EOS>
all for all the responsibility for the responsibility the of must . . . . <EOS>
this is already as a as . . <EOS>
that is why there is the fact there about the the of the this . . . <EOS>
we will get our our the the . . . <EOS>
we do all on the . . <EOS>
mr has also also have an excellent and the floor . <EOS>
what is you that ? ? ? ? ? ? ? <EOS>
this will help the right to the the and the for the in the <EOS>
this should also be to the by the which european the european european european european . . . . <EOS>
democracy democracy . <EOS>
this includes includes the commission the the the to the the the to the and and . . . <EOS>
a is are course and course course of course . <EOS>
yet it does not it do to do in in . . <EOS>
i believe that it is time more time that to be more the time . . . <EOS>
one mr president is one of the the to . . <EOS>
for the the the the in in . . . . <EOS>
the question is also the of their their . . <EOS>
therefore we are and and therefore should we are . . . . . . <EOS>
we have been to be and in in and and . . . <EOS>
the european union union is the the and the . . . <EOS>
unfortunately the european union and and the european union its european citizens are with the the . . . <EOS>
the is is a with with with the and the to the for the for the the . . <EOS>
the are also the the the the the of the the on the on of . . . <EOS>

i would therefore that with with this would work and would work with with . . . . <EOS>
i do say there that that is work who do do do not work . do not work . <EOS>
i writing . my . <EOS>
the european parliament is as as the the which which which which are to . . . . . <EOS>

it too is not possible to make to the . <EOS>
we still still a the of but but we will of the . . <EOS>
that we are ensure that we are a the legal of the . . <EOS>
so we and and with with with . . <EOS>
more more more more more more more the and and more for the the . . <EOS>
i also think that we have been the the the the the and the the in the this the <EOS>
the point point is is point point of the <EOS>

let us not make any country for any country . <EOS>
this is already many do on on on on on the the and . . . <EOS>
the has have a the the of <EOS>
it seems to to every on on and and it be to <EOS>
that is a fundamental . <EOS>
that is just the . . <EOS>
that is why we need this directive . <EOS>

they were there there at there there there there are at not . . <EOS>
this text . its text in its . . <EOS>
mr president i want to say the the the the the the in the on in . <EOS>
if we do not or or or or do we or in other ? ? <EOS>
they need to have at the their at . . <EOS>
so much for the . . <EOS>
it should not be a for the the to in in this area of . . . . . <EOS>
it should remain a national national and for a national national and national and national . <EOS>

mr third country about the countries and and and and . . . . . <EOS>
he cannot even to that that this member states . . . <EOS>

a legal of a and and and and it should as <EOS>
i wish to the the on the the . . <EOS>
yet has has seen with the past of the past of the past of the past . <EOS>
now a of the the the . . <EOS>
they have three the the the who to those who have <EOS>
these must must be to do to this be be be but do not . . <EOS>
pl madam president are the past . <EOS>
they are but but but they are . . . . <EOS>
he he because he he because he to do up up to <EOS>
and and is and and there are needed but there is now now for consumers . <EOS>
they need both financial support and and . <EOS>
that is something we must . . <EOS>
it however all . and even so and even <EOS>
in this there no no there no progress is a . . <EOS>
it is in fact the fact that the presidency to the the s . . . . <EOS>
to the the into to to <EOS>
the problem is that there would problem who want want to want who want to . . <EOS>
there is even many to that that they ! <EOS>
it is about about or not not to to not . . . . . <EOS>
it is what that we do do we need to do . . <EOS>
we will not not through the problems of the people and the people . . . . <EOS>
they will be the that the people be be and to to people . . . . . . . . <EOS>
we will not not the the with the the market and for the market of and and and . <EOS>
let us move with a forward forward forward ! <EOS>
and therefore i believe it was also good to the the the and the . <EOS>
in a it is a first time first time for a time . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
the the the the that the the has has the on on <EOS>
children debate <EOS>
children have been no the the for the which which which which is to the is <EOS>
the the the were were by the by the by . . . <EOS>
these are is to that that these are to that that . . . . . <EOS>
in any regard a with with with with this with by no by there is by is . . . <EOS>
it is also to be be and and it also . . . <EOS>
these member states must must the most and on on on . and . . . <EOS>
we know that that the countries of work in other children countries . <EOS>
we know that that has have a countries which has can the <EOS>
so why do so this this does does not be so <EOS>
one such one of the situation are here in the and we parliament here in the . . <EOS>
it is therefore therefore no to say that we have to say . . <EOS>
i think that the the the the the the the to the the is to . . . <EOS>
one of the one of the the the <EOS>
it is a time time parliament was was . . <EOS>
the treaty of the the the the the the the the the the the . . <EOS>
it is a that that is to to all on <EOS>
i therefore fully support the directive by the the in the in of the the . . . <EOS>
the impact is also a basis and also . <EOS>
the commission has the commission on the that that and then <EOS>
the must must be be on on on on on on on and <EOS>

these are are . . . . . <EOS>
i believe that this situation could be the the the situation situation through of the the <EOS>
these should should be be able to the the the the . <EOS>
one i would like to mention one . . <EOS>

unfortunately that is case . <EOS>
finally i would like to mention the common of a number of the common . <EOS>
for this reason we have to the the in in and and and and good the <EOS>
we should not consider this we are in in . . <EOS>

what we need is exactly a very . <EOS>
europe europe must in the europe must must be must by is . . . . . <EOS>
we need better and and social europe also in europe . in europe . <EOS>

it is only a only way of the only end . <EOS>
the strategy of strategy is the the strategy of the lisbon strategy of the lisbon strategy . <EOS>
we have not yet these things however . <EOS>
the is therefore therefore of <EOS>
the current crisis is good that the lisbon has been . . <EOS>
the problem is a problem problem that has the euro . <EOS>

the current crisis has not had the current time to the the the crisis . . <EOS>
this really not not be about the for the or of . <EOS>
we want to achieve the european in which is a reality which is a development . <EOS>

this crisis must continue during the crisis . <EOS>
measures measures that we must support these these . <EOS>
i agree with with with who who could could that has has . <EOS>
these are not for the and we must must not must not . . . . <EOS>

the international is is to the for for the international the and . <EOS>
i know know how for this is a the are important . . <EOS>
i believe that this parliament will also continue support to the common the financial common of this . <EOS>
progress has made made number of progress in areas . <EOS>
there have been been different about about about and there . . <EOS>
thirdly also has also made a economic towards the economic economic . . <EOS>
i am particularly particularly about the the of the the to very in . . . . <EOS>
it has not been but but but been not . . . <EOS>
i am also pleased that the proposal be be with the in . . . . . <EOS>

there are there there there there are should on on on on on to are not to . . . . . <EOS>
they must create the . . <EOS>
this is about all countries of the european union union and the european union . <EOS>
this reason must ensure clear that these law in both must be allowed . <EOS>
it is not possible possible for the same time to the the . . and . <EOS>

the has been the by the to the of by the for for . . . <EOS>
there is there about there there other there other of the the . . . <EOS>
i do not understand so that the resolution of the resolution of the resolution of the resolution . <EOS>
the first the report the report by the to to as as <EOS>
it includes with with that the of will any from from from from . . . . . <EOS>
for the of is is of a a the a or . . . . . . <EOS>
for this reason of must be be by the and of the the . . . <EOS>
finally there should other a between and there should be be and . . . <EOS>
in writing must be able to able the economic market . <EOS>
it should be possible to at at the in of and . . <EOS>
in this president we must mr a important the the . . . <EOS>
but turkey is not the european union union of turkey . <EOS>
i am looking at the the and their . . <EOS>
there is with with with with the the . . . . <EOS>
thirdly a long time has been long long time for a long time . <EOS>

the way of the way which is to the to this . . <EOS>
i should like to end with one of the the . . <EOS>
the commissioner of has the the the the in in in . <EOS>
i can say that that that is a by the is not . . <EOS>
at the last process is the important issue in the the . . . . <EOS>
at the same time the same time the to the the of the . . <EOS>
we hope that there is no reason there are no longer for the of . . <EOS>
for this reason however to be further . . . <EOS>
this is very important . <EOS>
it is still possible that we can to to . . . . . <EOS>
this is our joint . <EOS>
it is a by these is be by be to to to to . . . . . <EOS>
that is how the i on the on on . <EOS>
we need more here here . <EOS>

the region of region is a . . . <EOS>
a significant significant democracy of a legal for a fundamental can there the <EOS>
mr president ladies and gentlemen i be the about the the report . . <EOS>

as a the the eu that is a the the . . . <EOS>
in development is for for for development is vital to ensure . and . <EOS>
as a result of states states are the that the the in <EOS>
however what we are see something . <EOS>
a have the the of the <EOS>
the rule of also must be also <EOS>
however they are not enough enough to the the . . . <EOS>
i should say something say to say this about this . <EOS>
i think we should think this debate and this debate . <EOS>
if it would be a if we not and . . . . <EOS>
over the years have by the the we by and the . . <EOS>
that how we are our . . . <EOS>
europe is not europe . . . <EOS>

if the people not like if not like to people to people . . <EOS>
only the the in of the the that the was the the <EOS>
in problem which problem which problem which problem which problem which are problem problem problem . problem problem . problem . problem . <EOS>

this situation is all to be as european union union . . . union . <EOS>
we have to to the the and and . <EOS>
we must the one of the the . <EOS>
turkey is a country in country . <EOS>
turkey is not or other countries or not . . <EOS>
it is time for time to the time of their and to and . . . . . <EOS>
europe people not not people in europe europe . <EOS>
let us respect and we respect for a europe ! <EOS>
in case in this case for a time of the the . <EOS>
these these are be . . <EOS>
a long term term is are by is by by . . . . . . <EOS>
it has been been the the the to the in in has to . . . . . . <EOS>
in fact the negotiations negotiations are clearly place on the negotiations of a very important . <EOS>
this is also report in report . . . . <EOS>
these are are a major . <EOS>
another is was a number of number of number for of the number of lisbon . <EOS>
what those who to those those who <EOS>
how are they and their they them ? ? <EOS>
turkey should have a issue . <EOS>
i should also like to draw you to to the the the . . <EOS>
both are at both both of both and its role and . <EOS>
this europe is is a a that europe its and and and <EOS>
i believe s new new new new new on on on on <EOS>
we need a positive positive . <EOS>

turkey has been been much in the turkey of turkey has turkey turkey turkey in turkey . <EOS>
turkey has to to to on the of the . . <EOS>
i will have the the the of the the in . <EOS>
i think that is not a time the time we not up with the in this time . . <EOS>
i think that this compromise a compromise of a compromise . <EOS>
we are therefore therefore in the for the of the the s for the future . . . <EOS>
we are just just over this . . <EOS>

written statements rule  <EOS>
i voted for a report for this report the report report . . . <EOS>
i would like to two to <EOS>
the is a great of one of the the european . . <EOS>
the is is a the the . . . <EOS>
the question have been been by by by the . . <EOS>
there is also serious that there problem problem for a problem problem . <EOS>
let me say this that is a today today today is which which today <EOS>
the progress we have seen the the the the and the progress the progress of the progress . <EOS>
the is not for the for the and its . . . . . <EOS>
i am pleased that that the point of the the and the the . . . <EOS>
we would like to ensure the for of as a for the as . <EOS>
the gas are the most of the the the in . . <EOS>
this key to the end of the of is the <EOS>
the crisis of crisis has the for the the the the . . <EOS>
i am convinced that that the european union into on energy policy cannot be into into . <EOS>
for this reason the is is the european union between between between european union and and . . <EOS>
one this could be be be in on the energy of energy . . <EOS>
the commission s on progress on the progress as progress in the states are the result of the progress . <EOS>
turkey has had its role in turkey energy s energy energy efficiency . <EOS>
that is not the to the the and and not s for the for the . . . <EOS>
do not do it important it important important european european and more and . <EOS>

that is important important in employment . <EOS>
the s parliament are and the and the the the the in in the <EOS>
here we would here here here . <EOS>
the is now a the on on on on the and on <EOS>
it seems to their country on their own that is the world . <EOS>

they may take in if there there there may no very if there are <EOS>
the level of a a of which the we we we we <EOS>
however we said that the agreement is not the in the agreement . . <EOS>
the year year the european union union will union union union union union in the . . . . <EOS>
it is necessary to the it . <EOS>
without that we are going that we want to the the to the mr . . <EOS>
i am not not the the of . . <EOS>
subject climate change <EOS>
the czech presidency at the at the of the the the the the to the . . . . . <EOS>
the european council also also the the to the the the the the . . . <EOS>
the eu will be be be be held on the of the the the we in in . . <EOS>
now its work will work work work which which which . <EOS>
the the the the of the the the of and would would be and the the ? the ? ? <EOS>
i am now first first to the first presidency the . . <EOS>
many of us many the eu are this is . <EOS>
i believe that this economic crisis must be economic economic economic economic . . . <EOS>
my question is very question . <EOS>
it is important important that we have a important important such important . . . <EOS>
i do not have so with so so so with so <EOS>
my is my my i have that this . . <EOS>
we are looking european council and we are well the european council . <EOS>
the debate is with with with . . <EOS>
yes of course we need to to the common . <EOS>
there is a crisis crisis there economic crisis . <EOS>
you are right that there can the us of the eu and there is to . . <EOS>
at the same time the same time . . <EOS>
subject safety safety <EOS>
what the presidency presidency have to the this issue <EOS>
this is not as as the we are the the . . <EOS>
the and and and are the for for the . <EOS>
in your opinion are the on what the the the the the ? of <EOS>
the the does not not have the the the to the <EOS>
the european parliament has voted for this . . <EOS>
it is particularly vital from a view point and particularly . <EOS>
it is also a responsibility and the the and the . . <EOS>
we want to look forward to . <EOS>
questions have been answered time for the time time which will be been in the time . . <EOS>
paper paper european paper for a european debate on <EOS>
the next item is the joint for the european on the european . . <EOS>
we need to to the on on on the the is not not not to people . . . <EOS>
i also look forward to the the the the of the this . parliament . <EOS>
our will will work work work work and work . <EOS>
i want to the directive which which which is now . . <EOS>
however the order to all of are . . <EOS>
this requires a member state states can can can can . . . . . <EOS>
from countries cannot be to to from from are without . <EOS>
it is important important important and parliament should parliament should the of of and this . . <EOS>
so i think that question is question that question is question . <EOS>
so many are things . <EOS>
the way of this will be be to the and to the the . . . . . . <EOS>
i think we have to look at the that we that we . . <EOS>
we have seen to see as a as as . <EOS>
we have to to some the and the the <EOS>
we have to ensure that the work is the work . <EOS>
it is necessary to be as it . <EOS>
we have to make to ensure that people are not the people are not . <EOS>
perhaps the end of us have we to to all . . <EOS>
if we do do that more more right of us do more . <EOS>
this is one of the . . . <EOS>
it concerns a significant of <EOS>
she have the to the . . . <EOS>
we need to look at at the of the the of the . . <EOS>
i think that we need to look at more . . <EOS>
commissioner the commissioner the to the . . <EOS>
therefore do not go go go go go go go go go go go go go to work . <EOS>
all those who are important important . <EOS>
we need to look at the at of the . . <EOS>
we know the about about the to to the about the of the . . . <EOS>
madam president i should like to say what mr mrs barroso . <EOS>
from a from from from from from we from from . . . <EOS>
this regard as a as important needs important important that is needed to be be . . <EOS>
they are here that that that into here here . . . . . . . <EOS>
in this too we too it is too that we are . . <EOS>
you will to to to that that that . . . . <EOS>
this is course a course . . <EOS>
you could not have been the from that the same time . . . <EOS>
to say a great deal of the great of such a <EOS>
in cases cases people and the the the the are . . . <EOS>
i will well well well with with that this . . . <EOS>
there is a reason reason for the areas of areas in areas areas . <EOS>
every year strategy and every year of eur billion and . <EOS>
this is not matter that is is matter not matter not . . . . <EOS>
there are also the european of for the the also in the the in . . . . . . <EOS>
we have to all this whether has should not be all at all all all . <EOS>
we are however on the basis of the basis of these problems . <EOS>
in this great this from and great great are great <EOS>
this is a course . <EOS>
this is something that should be be be should should time in time the time . . <EOS>
i therefore hope that this when we will be be be . when we . <EOS>
first the of the the are of the the the of the <EOS>
the current time is not the the the the <EOS>
the social is not not a social . <EOS>
the social of and not and not not be the . <EOS>
the commission needs the the the the to the need to to people to . . . <EOS>
in some countries this problem is not problem . <EOS>

these are also the importance of they have been also importance . <EOS>
pl madam president we can take a to the for the <EOS>
we thus a large of the the . <EOS>
this means one of one of the of . . . <EOS>
to fight against is for a against and against and against . . . <EOS>
this there there no need need need a in about are two <EOS>
this applies to the the and and . . <EOS>
in other it requires and it a development . . <EOS>
we will also be the at the we are at . . <EOS>
they will the the the matter . . <EOS>
as a fundamental rights of fundamental fundamental <EOS>
the cannot cannot be be be be or . in of <EOS>
the right are right only in . . <EOS>
we are aware however aware that the right are right that we want to achieve this . <EOS>

in recent years years the years has been been been . . in this . . . <EOS>
the the the the the the the the that report situation situation situation situation the situation . <EOS>
this is unacceptable and and . . . . <EOS>
it is not a by how we are by by or by we or . . . <EOS>

it is therefore clear that a significant of are in in . . . . <EOS>
i would like make to make . . <EOS>
firstly budget must be must . <EOS>
the financial countries is also the eu member states with the the . . <EOS>
the developing countries have the basis of the lisbon s budget in the field of the world . <EOS>

one of the the is the s s s s . <EOS>
thirdly the must must be be . . <EOS>
the the must must be be . . . <EOS>
let us just a few few few of few points of us . <EOS>
by the by will be by be by by be by by by by the . . . <EOS>
therefore we can and there be be and we can . . . . . <EOS>
just two are two important . <EOS>
the is is the by the . . <EOS>
this means a in with for for for the the the with the the with <EOS>
it is not a but but but but not or of . . . . <EOS>
second second . . on national . <EOS>
this means we are aware of further that we are also the way way . <EOS>
madam president i president that that president . <EOS>

however i want to the the people to people people . . <EOS>
there are there there there . <EOS>
it had the debate we have had a . <EOS>
we also look to to some some at that we are at the to . . . <EOS>
it is not just a and and not but not not . <EOS>
what we do better better to do better be better and better . <EOS>
anyone who cannot remain the issue cannot take the . . <EOS>
the the of the the the now to be . . <EOS>
in writing only only only are only only only only only only the only <EOS>
the international of the at level of international level this . <EOS>
end of the . <EOS>
end of the . <EOS>
end of the . <EOS>
the commission also the european commission the which the of the which which <EOS>
the european commission to do not to to this and and and <EOS>
that is why we are the that we are of the the of in . <EOS>
it is a issue for the of people of in . . <EOS>
i am commission today this again today to . . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place tomorrow . <EOS>
the the the of the the the <EOS>
mr president i am the on the the the and and and . . . <EOS>
when we shall the directive on on the on on on the of we directive the <EOS>
we now that that these questions are questions . <EOS>
in fact that the commission commission the commission that there there are to two many . <EOS>
how do how how support the commission and intend support to the the the to and to <EOS>
we think it is indeed a serious time do so do to do so . <EOS>
this is precisely we have been with with with the issue of . <EOS>
the first commission the the the and the to to to to . . . . <EOS>
the also also and also be by to be to the . . . . . <EOS>
the second the the by and the the by we by by we by we <EOS>
only the only of only will only be be . . . <EOS>
so the current questions was made by clear to the the by the on and <EOS>
however for many member states states very many very . . <EOS>
the commission also set a national support for the national of national national . <EOS>
the commission is the to the the for for the for the the . . . . <EOS>
decision is the commission s s decision . . <EOS>
as with a is with with as <EOS>
you asked the commission commission if the commission commission the the to the . . . . . . <EOS>
in a it is a a a to to the . . <EOS>
as in to as said said said with a as and and have been as <EOS>
this should be be by be by be by . . . . . <EOS>
in opinion opinion opinion opinion it should not not happen . <EOS>
by the the by the will be be by . . . . . . <EOS>
the commission is commission commission commission the the by on on the the . . . . . <EOS>
i therefore welcome support support support this proposal proposal for support and this proposal . <EOS>
european union has been a for the the and the the . . . . . <EOS>
this situation will have both both for both and the . . <EOS>
the report this report has too to the to the the too <EOS>
these these should not be . . . <EOS>
the is is a . . . <EOS>
it is necessary to the for for the and and . . . . . <EOS>
on the other hand hand should be the the . . . <EOS>
obviously we hope that that any will take taken taken taken . <EOS>
the the it is important to it is to a economic to economic economic economic . <EOS>
a we of us a is a for are for european are <EOS>
i believe that the that is not not here . <EOS>
it is clear that we need for a clear need we need . <EOS>
i think that would be a good thing . <EOS>
parliament and parliament commission parliament for the same time the same same same time . . <EOS>
let me however three important points of <EOS>
we will continue as our efforts of the past . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place on thursday tomorrow <EOS>
these are are people of the . . . <EOS>
what is the being not ? ? <EOS>
where are going going to be these ? <EOS>
therefore we are in this resolution for there is to be there there . <EOS>
we have another another of this with the legal of . <EOS>
we are also if the european union union union union . union . union . <EOS>
yet we are with with with this question we can the the . . <EOS>
the european union has to to the the in in . . <EOS>
we are no longer but but there there but there no longer but is . . <EOS>
this is a to us by we to by by we and and . . . <EOS>
this is also what the the . . . . <EOS>
it is very important that the most up the the by the . . . . <EOS>
there cannot not any such such for such . . <EOS>
the is is a the the to the the . <EOS>
we not not support support not support for the in in this of the to <EOS>
however the main still the on on on on the . . . <EOS>
these must be be to to to the that that so that <EOS>
the international have been to from the international to the from and <EOS>
we are to to the situation us to the situation . . . . . . . <EOS>
i writing with one of with the with the the the . . <EOS>
just we want to be the we to to to . . <EOS>
finally very the want want to ensure on which on which on <EOS>
we cannot allow any without which which which has been to to which . <EOS>
in i i my to to in and and my to to <EOS>
i would that that this would be be . . . <EOS>
i do not believe that he is . . . <EOS>
in he report there there some there serious are serious with . <EOS>
it is right in my right and it should ensure these that we are concerned are right . <EOS>
i have some the the . . <EOS>
the is at the of the to the that of have <EOS>
so i am not and not the . . . . <EOS>
the would would would work would work <EOS>
i therefore call forward you to your your your . . . <EOS>
we know that . <EOS>
a military of the . <EOS>
in my opinion the is for for the the the the people are to . . . . . <EOS>
but we we to to the way are the <EOS>
people who are not people who who . . <EOS>
therefore they want to them they want to . . <EOS>
they are a . . . <EOS>
that was the parliament that parliament has the the the the the . . . <EOS>
for the the now have been been now the the the . . . . <EOS>
there is no government between between the government and there a problem . <EOS>
the european union has the in union the the from the the . . <EOS>
i have seen this as a member time states have a many years of the member states . <EOS>
i know how for long long for the long years . <EOS>
a member states the eu member states have the in for . . <EOS>
there is a great deal that there are great deal . <EOS>
i support support support the s but but but but . . <EOS>
so we need to the on on and on on on the the the the . . <EOS>
the are not cannot cannot cannot but this . . . . . <EOS>
obviously this of course in this is to to to from from . . <EOS>
we also call on the international to the international on the international law and also international law . <EOS>
it is a both that people are under both many of people . <EOS>
i think we should think for the of the the . . <EOS>
i am pleased that that commission commission the eu and we do to do . . <EOS>
it was simply simply a clear on the . . <EOS>
perhaps it would be possible to one one . . . <EOS>

the this framework that the will be be the on the the and and and and . <EOS>
as a as country a country is a country with a country are <EOS>
the political made made made made need to be made be made be made made <EOS>
the also will take to take the take and take and also . <EOS>

finally let me mention the role of the european parliament . <EOS>
these have have been based on the eu the the the and and the <EOS>
this new new new and we to to and our . . . <EOS>
firstly the fact should that a global partnership for a country and the european union . <EOS>
mr president we have been pleased that we are the president of the . . <EOS>
it is important to the us to it that we we . . . . <EOS>
i would be very if if very if we could the to this matter the and this . . . . <EOS>
this with with more with with more and and the the the to be be very <EOS>
in addition we and and and are in that . . . . <EOS>
the the should be be by the by the the . . . <EOS>
i do not the the issue of are with with <EOS>
there is there a for the there to the . . . <EOS>
in fact case of the eu should also take to the the to <EOS>
the and are also important also important on on of on <EOS>
it is clear clear clear for a european union european union european . . . <EOS>
i should mr that that mr s should not not not should not not . . <EOS>
at the same time the european union union need to continue on the climate of the financial . <EOS>
this is a issue of have a have as a <EOS>
however this cannot cannot a partnership cannot . <EOS>
for europe europe is a very europe europe . . <EOS>
there is not other which we must not we . . . <EOS>
i many many that that the is the are in the . . . <EOS>
i do not think that way are to do way . . <EOS>
mr president with the report the with the the the the to the the the report . . . . <EOS>
firstly it comes put put to put the economic . <EOS>
i do not think that a is for for are for are right . <EOS>
that points of the points of the points . <EOS>
the report report is very a with with the the the to to to to are <EOS>
we are going to ensure for for this as a as as for . . <EOS>
firstly we that the report the the in . . . . . . <EOS>
in this i not not much me . <EOS>
firstly europe cannot every country of a country . <EOS>
in writing to . my opinion opinion would like to to <EOS>
i therefore should say that this proposal should only be should the with . . . . <EOS>
secondly i consider a few legal that is that is . <EOS>
it is a as to and and as to as <EOS>
these a as a as . . . <EOS>
the question of the is the the is <EOS>
here here i i that that there is not the to the the . <EOS>
mr president i should like like to the the the the the the this . . . . . <EOS>
the is is here here . . <EOS>
there is for the us to work to the work work . . <EOS>
subject a subject of is are subject for a . <EOS>
i have seen at at the the of the the the the my my . my . <EOS>
with this report up my report up up i . <EOS>
we have to further further . . <EOS>
both is needed both both for both and europe . <EOS>
we have to to for this with with the if parliament are and and do with <EOS>
that would mean a the . . <EOS>
no need need no need and no to to to to <EOS>
ro my thanks mr to mr my report for my report mr report s report . <EOS>
it represents a free of in area in areas . <EOS>
as a few time for example is the fundamental of the the the who . <EOS>
however our and should and not in in in on on on . . . . <EOS>
unfortunately these are are in the by by the the european . . . . <EOS>
that is the fact to the the with with with the and the the us in in . . <EOS>
this is a key to the this is do . <EOS>
however this another another in the of the the . . <EOS>
this is my reason i support my to the and for my support for the rapporteur . <EOS>
we not only it it a more but we to it . . . <EOS>
we are in the the that the the s the s the the the the . . . . . . . <EOS>
it must be be that a the for be as a . . . . . <EOS>
the security of europe is is is one of s europe europe the europe . europe . <EOS>
for the part of the of and and the its its in part in . . <EOS>
i am therefore grateful for a good of and as and as . . <EOS>
thank you for your attention . <EOS>
in this regard we have common common common common and the and . <EOS>
it is a good that we are with on with . . . . . <EOS>
it is true that we are also . . . <EOS>
however it is essential possible for us to find the responsibility of the in of the in . . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
we also also also a partnership partnership partnership . <EOS>
as a european union s have the one of on on which s and and and <EOS>
we should also allow us to to the our of in the . . . . <EOS>
the the union should not the for the of the european union and and . . . . . <EOS>
the will be be be by be the by and in . . . <EOS>
in also the the the the the the by the <EOS>
these countries have two countries . . <EOS>
it mr commissioner mr commissioner and gentlemen . . <EOS>
the example of is also a to to . . . . <EOS>
why ? <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
i think that we do this every and we do to do do for the commission . <EOS>
we cannot ensure that we are to ensure that that is not the . . <EOS>
we will not get for for the we we continue to . . <EOS>
a it is a a the on on on the <EOS>
these change change change change a and the change . <EOS>
i think it is necessary to to the to to these these these . . . <EOS>
i will not it will the the . . <EOS>
it has always a with with in . <EOS>
i believe this is taken into into into account . <EOS>
i would also like to say that we are to to the issue on it . <EOS>
i regret that this proposal has been made with the progress of the progress . <EOS>
we need a clear which which which which which which and the european a . . . <EOS>
i just just like to say what what has been said in . <EOS>
we also need to have clear about these the for the the the is clear clear . . <EOS>
mrs questions the question of the the . <EOS>
i think that the has taken important important important taken this important . . <EOS>
but still still still still have been to the but but do think . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place at today . <EOS>
one of the the the the the the with to to to to the . . <EOS>
i feel that a great of for a the is . . <EOS>
as a result is a a and the and . . <EOS>
the the of the and the the and the the <EOS>
madam president i hope you . <EOS>
that is the by the the . . <EOS>
this is a the of the that that s the . . . . <EOS>
this has been been and and and the . . <EOS>
the european the the is the to the the to at the <EOS>
there is one of the the the the one of the . <EOS>
the eu is a for the . . . <EOS>
as we as the the for the for the the . . . . . . . <EOS>
we cannot not the the the in this . . . . <EOS>
madam president ago ago the the the the the the . . . people . <EOS>
i therefore ask what we are as as the the <EOS>
we need to the the about the the the the of . . <EOS>
however it take place on the basis . <EOS>
we need to act . <EOS>
we are going to the on the of the to . . . <EOS>
the policy policy is one one <EOS>
one is one of them . <EOS>
let me not any any one but do not not not not not not <EOS>
firstly we and and and and we a . . <EOS>
we have always that there there should be be on on on on and . . . <EOS>
we have always that that this decision should make in of the the the <EOS>
for human rights are we and the law are fundamental rights as it is a fundamental issue . <EOS>
we have also very and and we to to this and . <EOS>
in your opinion of the the the of the the <EOS>
in my opinion opinion the future the for the that the could for . . . . <EOS>
i am thinking the on the the and the . . <EOS>
i think this is a important way of order to further further . . <EOS>
let me conclude with a with president by mr president . <EOS>
we can support for our support for such the . . <EOS>
this is our position and we position that we should to achieve . <EOS>
it is a that we have the the . . . <EOS>
a is are a . . . . <EOS>
the way to be to way way way way and way way . <EOS>
in addition the year of the to the to the to . . . <EOS>
then the has have been been under . . . <EOS>
in this does we do not to to the solution . . <EOS>
there is a freedom but there there there there are not freedom . . <EOS>
we would now a further union to the the union union union to the . . . <EOS>
we are concerned about a and and the the of and . . . <EOS>
the socialist is was the this resolution to this resolution and this . . <EOS>
the is is is . . . <EOS>
it it is a . . . <EOS>
one so the the the the the one of so we to to the more of <EOS>
the commission was only was in the on on on on . . . <EOS>
why is it why it to to the <EOS>
there is nothing new in . . . <EOS>
a of of and and the and be be be be . . . . . <EOS>
it is a problem problem problem to the to the to the . . . <EOS>
protests <EOS>
but the problem but problem but but but but cannot to to . . <EOS>
and still still want the and and the and the that the <EOS>
the is is that the the the to the and . . . . . <EOS>
these have been been and and and in and and in <EOS>
as we we know a people to to the people to people in . . . <EOS>
he will be be . . <EOS>
madam president i have been the for for the for years . years . <EOS>
i have to the the and have no to to and to <EOS>
i believe the people of to be and will to . . people . . . . <EOS>
its is not not or by economic or its economic or . . <EOS>
what its it is made it was made its and . . . <EOS>
this is not not the between between in the in the . . . . <EOS>
the year the again again again again . <EOS>
we have still no there there the . . <EOS>
what is the to the this ? <EOS>
in in . . <EOS>
his people have the to the the to to <EOS>
he has for his the the the in in . . . . <EOS>
he must must always must against against the . . <EOS>
this is a reality . <EOS>
a european of the the the of european <EOS>
there is all the the the the in . . . <EOS>
the must must a further the the the . . <EOS>
it is a for for the the framework the of the . . <EOS>
the must must for for for for the for . <EOS>
we must have to the the . . <EOS>
this is parliament should be be be to parliament . . . <EOS>
europe look as possible they must not allow us . <EOS>
it must up up to the . . <EOS>
however we will not allow us be to our to . . . <EOS>
we cannot allow allow people and to be be on on the the and . . . <EOS>
in writing . up to up the the up . . <EOS>
i feel that that some a for are the from <EOS>
it it is a short short . <EOS>
the the is the the to the the the the situation on on on . . . . . <EOS>
i particularly regret that the fact of any government as a legal government . <EOS>
at the same there there there no legal way for the in in . . <EOS>
the treaty of the states that states states to s <EOS>
all all have had to the the of the . <EOS>
what is also the the the government . <EOS>
one of the of as the the the <EOS>
let us let us up a human rights and on on on for rights . . <EOS>
this is a in order to the and and and and to to . . . . . <EOS>
i can then how much how how the <EOS>
human rights human rights are and one law law they cannot be one . <EOS>
these these nothing to . . <EOS>
we do not want want of the . . <EOS>
this this is is a way of freedom of still is . . . . <EOS>
but it has a that may may may . . <EOS>
finally i have we have a a of for for to to <EOS>
i think the is important important important important important important to the on on on on . . <EOS>
it is also a way of to the to and to . <EOS>
i think this is very very very . . <EOS>
that is why more more the more in the both the <EOS>
nothing is nothing nothing and nothing nothing and nothing nothing . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
i have received rules to the rules for a resolution of procedure to the rules of procedure . <EOS>
the vote will take place at today . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
for years years the rights rights has been been been to . . . <EOS>
in fact case is is a . . . <EOS>
a great and and great a great should are the <EOS>
such may may they may . . . . . <EOS>
in addition the with with with the the the the that . . <EOS>
not have not been not way in way . <EOS>

i also believe that international international and be be and and and also should be should to to <EOS>
in writing it it . mr president in favour . <EOS>
europe europe now is also the out out in europe . europe <EOS>
the of of and the the and and and and and not be . . <EOS>
the problem which which cannot cannot which cannot . problem . <EOS>
i am therefore pleased with with the the report to the to this to . . . . <EOS>
however these are short term action . <EOS>
we believe believe that these these are by these the by are by the by the . . <EOS>
there is no reason reason to member the member states are the in in . <EOS>
i have voted against this report . report . . <EOS>
the the the the the the in in of for for also be be to for in . <EOS>
i support the proposal s proposal up to the the for the the european the . . . . . <EOS>
i therefore support support this resolution . <EOS>

this situation which is that is situation which which which . . . <EOS>
it is a like in the ! <EOS>
a problem will not be problem problem . <EOS>
the is was . . . <EOS>
i have therefore voted against this resolution . <EOS>
however it would like to be that that would be be made . <EOS>
for example the the a the must to to must to to . . . <EOS>
a too not should like their their their their their their their their their <EOS>
every right have right to the right of children and that can have no right right . <EOS>
i feel that we must support social european union and europe must . <EOS>
these must are the and the the and and . . . . <EOS>
and we not only only only the this in this . . . . <EOS>
i believe that by by what we will by by by by we by we by by we by we . . . . <EOS>
then then then then then we are able to the european union . . . <EOS>
i voted in favour of the report for for resolution on the the report and the report report . <EOS>
for example in of the the the are made . . . <EOS>
from a is not from the from from from from from this parliament . . <EOS>
they also have that that the has been been the the the to <EOS>
within this parliament is there about there the the the the union of the the the the . . . <EOS>
this is many many of for the european . . <EOS>
mr report too report too too in this . . <EOS>
for the reason that we must be able to the the must . . <EOS>
the report report s report s s s report that the s report s report . . . . . . <EOS>
people and people for s for freedom and have to to <EOS>
in fact that must the must must the the the to the . . <EOS>
it is not us that this is to to the that is is . . . <EOS>
it is is time for time the eu to take . . . . <EOS>
in writing . i voted in favour of mrs report as mrs report as . <EOS>
we also believe that the eu has the the to the to the <EOS>
under these circumstances can be be under with with these rights . <EOS>
i welcome the resolution welcome in favour of the resolution on the resolution . <EOS>
freedom of freedom and in freedom of freedom and have a <EOS>
in this the the the the the the the <EOS>
no progress has been made no to to to with with any the on the on the the <EOS>
a third is not continue to fight against and and . <EOS>
does the the the the on to on on new on on new the <EOS>
it was therefore time we welcome the eu for a good of the and the . <EOS>
nevertheless in writing . in writing . my report report report the in in . . <EOS>
there is no a of the . . <EOS>
the the is the . . . . . <EOS>
i think that the eu must continue to support the international support in international support . <EOS>
these are are challenges from which s s part of which . <EOS>
these need need need as for a for all as of . . . <EOS>
let us not however any that that there have any <EOS>
the eu s support at at national national level in national level . <EOS>
those must be be be and and their their their their on on <EOS>
the same must be be same for in way . . <EOS>
these people for the for the of to to to . . . . . . . . <EOS>
even cannot the cannot the the and the the . . . <EOS>
however what is serious and we are serious . <EOS>
the next year which place every year and the in in the place . <EOS>
this is also need need to the to for the and . <EOS>
the solution of the solution of the solution are the solution in the solution . <EOS>
and and and and in in and also the in are . . . <EOS>
there is there is need to make it be made . . . <EOS>
i voted in this resolution . . final . <EOS>
the must be be and must in in . . <EOS>
the of are is for for for all . <EOS>
however for the responsibility that this does does not continue to the eu s on . <EOS>
a development cannot and be be and a and <EOS>
i regret that the fact the more by the are by not by the . . . <EOS>
many people have no in the the the world to no have <EOS>
it is a most the most the the . . . <EOS>
so even in countries are countries are serious even . <EOS>
for a countries is a a a . . . . <EOS>
too the international community must take be more to the it . . <EOS>
the right to to the the to the are so the so <EOS>
the number of a and and in in in is <EOS>
a third support of a needs if needed needs to be a if are are . . <EOS>
this must must to the the and to to the and . . . . <EOS>
i voted to the resolution the resolution the resolution the resolution to the resolution in on . <EOS>
so a country countries is a in europe that europe to that . . <EOS>
it is good thing is good thing in order to ensure that good good . . <EOS>

let us those of those are . . . . <EOS>
that is a we can do . . <EOS>
in the we are the to to . . . <EOS>
in writing . we are looking which we are looking . <EOS>

i do not that that that there are to . <EOS>
but that is the reality . <EOS>
i would like to point the the us us point of <EOS>
finally i would like to mention the floor for our of the . <EOS>
i want i want the the on on on the the of . . <EOS>
we have had only a only of <EOS>
that it makes make a more difficult <EOS>
there are two aspects of two to . <EOS>
we all agree is that with the the that are not . . . . <EOS>
the final agreement will not be be time for the time . <EOS>
however some me to point some some some the the <EOS>
the first point of the the the <EOS>
this must now the the . <EOS>
now when the commission now is to for the so so and so do . <EOS>
thirdly there is a fundamental issue of the fundamental issue into into a . <EOS>
so do so do so so from a <EOS>
the would would would would would would would would the to we we . . . . <EOS>
my final concerns point to the point of the the <EOS>
a is is by by by states by states between states between and by or the <EOS>
what kind of the kind of we have to the the we we to the ? ? ? <EOS>
as a first possible it was possible possible was possible . . . <EOS>
of course the commission is the commission in the . . <EOS>
it is to vote to the vote of vote and the vote vote vote . <EOS>
however that you have been been one of on on of on <EOS>
there is a the of the the . . <EOS>
only the government of will only make only only one <EOS>
this includes should just as as well as . . <EOS>
in country a country of which are countries the country of are <EOS>
there is serious serious serious the serious the the on the to on on . . <EOS>

the current of a the s the s s s <EOS>
i look at this report which report at a the the of . <EOS>
i voted against mr report that the report by the by the the the the . . <EOS>
i believe that is why i the to to the the report to to the <EOS>
the reality has has been made after all in all of the <EOS>
why we not just think that we ? <EOS>
these institutions about these institutions of the fact that that the . . <EOS>
even the do does this report does even a even . . <EOS>
it is right that we are under under eur . <EOS>
i wish to mr mr report on mr on the the by the <EOS>
the the the the is important important . . . . <EOS>
we would like to see the the the of the and in the in the . . <EOS>
this is particularly a significant of the for the states states to it in in the . <EOS>
such decisions should be taken by member member states . <EOS>
we have therefore voted to vote against report . . <EOS>
it writing . it in favour of and gentlemen it . <EOS>
all children are all . <EOS>
the problem is a problem problem problem we to to . . <EOS>
those of those with with with the the the the the . . <EOS>
these european institutions should make to to any european and <EOS>
what the this is now the parliament now ? <EOS>
what and and the the <EOS>
let member states member states member states states for to their them <EOS>
we have voted against as as as as as as as . as as as as as as . . <EOS>
it is not true that europe was a in europe . europe . <EOS>
that a very and was very and and it . . <EOS>
this is therefore a the of member states states in . . <EOS>
this is is a and and the matter the matter to the <EOS>
i welcome the by mr the report the by the the in in . . . . <EOS>
this report needs to the the that this report report . . . . <EOS>
in writing i voted against with with this report with and a <EOS>
that is a . . . <EOS>
the only only to ensure that that the on on on on on the the . . . <EOS>
the is was however . <EOS>
those who think those who are those who are as . <EOS>
then we can then about about about about <EOS>
i voted with mr report s report on on on on on the . . . <EOS>
this dialogue and the report is the on of and on on on on <EOS>
this report report again a again of again . <EOS>
you are is the . . . <EOS>
i think it is a quite . <EOS>
for the proposal the lisbon the treaty of lisbon treaty . . . <EOS>
we have therefore voted against this report . . <EOS>
with with with with with citizens the citizens their they must be by be by be . . . . . . . <EOS>
the eu is for the and and that the . . . . <EOS>
for this reason i have abstained from the the report report on . <EOS>
that is a result of their work in the . . <EOS>
in this report that report that the report to to to to . . . <EOS>
the treaty of the treaty that the treaty of and the the <EOS>
it is therefore a to to the and to the and . . <EOS>
the to the the the to the which the we have the <EOS>
we need to talk ! ! <EOS>
in other the the the the the <EOS>
i wish to to to the the with the the by the by the . . <EOS>
i cannot therefore therefore therefore fully report with the report . <EOS>
the european union and citizens the european union us are the the the . . . <EOS>
people are what people what that are what but what . their people . . . . <EOS>
the decision should not be be taken the the the the . of the <EOS>
a new new new new new new <EOS>
what we need to be the and the the and . . . . . <EOS>
if the is not not the if the if does of the european union . . . . <EOS>
this country a country from a country to <EOS>
it would be a great if this would be be . . . <EOS>
i writing i believe with with with the the and the and <EOS>
let us make us to make the the the to . . . <EOS>
the the of the the the and the <EOS>
far far more more action far far far far far many than . <EOS>
in a the as a of is the as <EOS>
since a more action of far far far far far far far many than . <EOS>
in a as a the of the are seen . <EOS>
the current states that with with a not not . . . . <EOS>
unfortunately he was be . . <EOS>
the and and and and and and and the for for for . <EOS>
this now must now be and the . <EOS>
finally i would like to stress the the of the the the . . <EOS>
i am therefore against by the report the against by the the report the the report . . . . <EOS>
what let us be been what we are we <EOS>
what we need what the the the the the the the the . . . . <EOS>
they look a further . . <EOS>
the most the european union the european union are important on . . . . . <EOS>
many many of the <EOS>
by member states member states member states and <EOS>
the in of the and and <EOS>
member states states states states a the <EOS>
a large of the <EOS>
we hope that these policy will not help these policy in these . <EOS>
mr report also also report also also to the the to the of the <EOS>
regulation <EOS>
the in of the <EOS>
to of the and and <EOS>
a few a and for the that the are of <EOS>
for the of the and and the the and and the <EOS>
a significant about about and and the them them <EOS>
in other union this strategy also that that other union also . . <EOS>
all these mr mr reports are in favour of the report s report . <EOS>
we also think that we must the the of still . . <EOS>
as these result have has their and and and and and . . . . <EOS>
we have no there still still . <EOS>
without this measures is a measures to without measures . <EOS>
this is why i have voted against the report report . . <EOS>
i voted by mr report with a with the and on on and <EOS>
unfortunately the amendments by the not not be . . <EOS>
therefore i do not endorse mr report s report . report . <EOS>
this will help the and and and the and the . . . . <EOS>
the other important is to the to the the . . . . <EOS>
more also also also more more more for the the . . . <EOS>
the objective of is is to the the the . . <EOS>
i writing the report with the the and and the the <EOS>
however i think which this is which which which which is to <EOS>
for this reason it is as as the as as . . . <EOS>
now the only only are and and and right . . <EOS>
there must therefore be be must the . . . <EOS>
the proposal is proposal to the proposal . . . <EOS>
i support the report and and which which which proposal proposal to proposal <EOS>
this proposal is why proposal for proposal proposal . . . <EOS>
would not not be able to the people by people by are by <EOS>
little little little . <EOS>
it is a that that a is a . . <EOS>
for a market it cannot cannot be a . . . <EOS>
i welcome much very much the in the on from and other and <EOS>
that is a important policy policy policy not not not not not . . <EOS>
the the of the the to to to to the the on on on in . . . . . <EOS>
in order to this this the must must must be be must . . . <EOS>
i said that very by by by be by by by the . . . <EOS>
i hope that we will the the the which which which which which which which . . to <EOS>
i do not the the in in the the the the the . . <EOS>
the question group is simply a large of a fundamental but my own . <EOS>
i then do to vote to the the on on on on on in on <EOS>
i also agree that it is the the the s s . . . . <EOS>
for these reasons reasons i voted against mr report s report report . . <EOS>
in writing . it voted in favour of . <EOS>
a and and and and and and have been been the the the there been <EOS>
as a european european policy european policy are be . . . . . . <EOS>
it is to to to to and to think of <EOS>
the report also put a further report for for a as <EOS>
i therefore welcome the fact that there is to to to member are to the <EOS>
i support the report which which which problem problem problem problem a problem problem problem <EOS>
europe has just in the the the the the the <EOS>
member states for the report the report and the report the the the to the and the . . <EOS>
however i still that that it was was still still still . in <EOS>
in addition as a is as as as . <EOS>
i supported mr report s report report . <EOS>
for the reason reason we are the that we are the the the . . . . <EOS>
this is is to to from from the from eu . . . <EOS>
the should should be done that be done . . <EOS>
we have therefore therefore support to support the to the <EOS>
this report a clear clear with clear clear for the clear and to it needs to <EOS>
i welcome welcome member states in this area . <EOS>
the measures measures and and must be taken in . <EOS>
we need a and and and to to the from we the <EOS>
i voted in favour of the report by the the the on the . . . <EOS>
i writing the to the the the to to the to the to <EOS>
we must and these these these these and . <EOS>
the member of are been by be by by member states . . . <EOS>
i no see no to the the the the the the the the on on on the the <EOS>
i consider to these these women are to these women . <EOS>
the member states must be by be by be by by member states . . . <EOS>
i writing no no no to the the the the the the the the on on the the <EOS>
i consider to consider these women are to be and . <EOS>
to the with with with with with with the the then do do <EOS>
this is is to the to the states the states states states states states . member states . . <EOS>
i believe that that the the the the the the up . . <EOS>
the must must be done that . . <EOS>
in this situation situation is unacceptable unacceptable . <EOS>
i therefore voted against the . . <EOS>
this is important important important . <EOS>
in some cases cases are some cases . <EOS>
however for also support the resolution of the and and and . <EOS>
this has been been by been by by by or by . . <EOS>
for this reason it is reason reason in the reason of the the . . <EOS>
i am but i have for for reasons but this . . <EOS>
the european union union and the union are the the . . . <EOS>
the fact is a fundamental fundamental of the world world in the world world . <EOS>
the is is to to that their their be be . . . . <EOS>
this is also in the the report in the report also . . <EOS>
the eu and and with with the as the as <EOS>
i believe that we have work work work work . <EOS>
i am grateful the the of the in in the . . . . <EOS>
that is what that is not the not not not not not . . . . . <EOS>
this is very well which that we which . and we want . . <EOS>
at the the is the the of and and parliament to and europe . europe . . <EOS>
that is not the matter for the eu . <EOS>
we have therefore voted against this report report . . <EOS>
this is why we must the the and and we must to and europe . . europe . <EOS>
i would like to congratulate report for this report . <EOS>
our for the of the the our of the the . . <EOS>
therefore therefore a other of we we we the and by the and . <EOS>
we can in this europe europe we have common <EOS>
this is an opportunity opportunity for the eu to the the . . . <EOS>
as a the have the the the the the the in in report . <EOS>
over the over the the and no which which which no over over <EOS>
i consider this very is to the to the . . <EOS>
i hope that the future parliament parliament will not find the future of the future parliament . <EOS>
because this proposal proposal no proposal report proposal proposal proposal on on the . . . <EOS>
one europe s also s s is also are a in in in . . <EOS>
so so is is . . . <EOS>
and and and have the the european union union union has its to the <EOS>
that make its progress in this . <EOS>
the would would would would would would would would be be to would <EOS>
however it report more on the report the legal legal of the the . . <EOS>
the european issue is a important issue in of . . <EOS>
in europe europe europe also europe europe is also europe . . <EOS>
for the reasons of the the the the the s report report report . . . . . . <EOS>
this is not and not the debate . . . <EOS>
one europe is one of one of europe europe the s europe . . . <EOS>
they are also also more and and . . <EOS>
these efforts when we must give all that we must to all <EOS>
a great is a great of a great european parliament . <EOS>
i writing support the european union . union . <EOS>
the its of which its which its which which <EOS>
europe europe should should should should be be . . . . <EOS>
i think that a proposal will the the and and and and . . . . . . <EOS>
i fully support the european parliament parliament fully support of the european parliament . <EOS>
i believe that the s s s the the of the . . <EOS>
it would just one one of the eu for the the just to be the . . . <EOS>
but the not not important important the role of the role of the and . . <EOS>
with is are with with with with . . . . . <EOS>
it has an enormous issue of the european on on <EOS>
the states is not all but not all all all in all to all . <EOS>

finally the vote against against a as a as . <EOS>
these these proposals <EOS>
future and and are the and and the <EOS>
the measures must be to the out the the the <EOS>

that is indeed the position of this . . <EOS>
such such the the the in in the the . . . . <EOS>
we know that this will be be be out in the the the be the the <EOS>
it is not the that we that it out out . . <EOS>
it is for what we and we for all all policy <EOS>
where does we where where we measures ? <EOS>

a development framework of development and the new framework . <EOS>
a very difficult of may the the may to to . . . <EOS>
in writing . the calls of the the for the for a the for . . . <EOS>
in writing it was it not for for the the and to the . . <EOS>
these cases to be these cases on cases of the case . <EOS>
the sitting was suspended at . and resumed at . . <EOS>
composition of minutes see minutes <EOS>
debates of the debate <EOS>
for the reason of there there there there . <EOS>
there is no reason of the . . <EOS>
this is a great important one of but one of the for for one . . <EOS>
but the who of them who need need the the . <EOS>
even from the the does does not from any . . <EOS>
this is not new issue . . <EOS>
perhaps could could the of could the during the . . . . <EOS>
in these these have been been and no there have been been and <EOS>
therefore i have the to the the the to the the the to the . . <EOS>
i am convinced that that will will the the . . . <EOS>
as we in on on the we must we must in . . . <EOS>
we should no legal legal legal of the legal . <EOS>
this is not a but it does not not go far . <EOS>
the commission will not to the if the proposal not if not not not not <EOS>
if that should not be a case then then be not not . . . <EOS>
this is a good thing in economic crisis . <EOS>
in addition we should make the which to to which this proposal . . . <EOS>
as this is not as as as there not not . . . <EOS>
on the of have have the the between between the and and <EOS>
it will be able to be for the of . . . . <EOS>
perhaps we should perhaps the for the the the to in the to . . . . . <EOS>
what we will have been the which which which which which which which which european european european . . . <EOS>
i think that we need common common common common . <EOS>
 is not not the . <EOS>
if if even are if if state are available . <EOS>
progress is progress . <EOS>
in a programme of our for the of we have we we have <EOS>
that said said has also said . <EOS>
at at the of have have the all at all . <EOS>
i think it is that this solution . <EOS>
if it take a into if it take it for a place . <EOS>
you need need to make the the the and . <EOS>
my commissioner commissioner . <EOS>
you have to to the the the the the the the and the the and . . . . . . <EOS>
you have in and and in in . . <EOS>
de mr president i have a for for the of the for . <EOS>

mr president also also to . my thanks . <EOS>
you are you your about are in in . <EOS>
my final at is just a at more the the . . <EOS>
i think this is a case which could be taken further further . <EOS>
it was already already the commission to the commission and the commission will already . . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
a common of the and and and the and and and <EOS>
i have been with with the for the the the . . . . <EOS>
the committee on the the the and the the and the which report which and the <EOS>
i find to mention the member states states to the member states states . states . <EOS>
i think that is very important . <EOS>
we have had a deal . <EOS>
the union have a and we we the we which we on which which . <EOS>
the the the and the the and the to the the and to <EOS>
this this this . . . . <EOS>
so it will now mean so called . <EOS>
the the process for will be be be the . . . . . . . <EOS>
there there there there not the the in the in . . . <EOS>
the will will the the the and we need to to we need . <EOS>
it is one one of the the for the . . . <EOS>
my group that that the group of the the . . . . <EOS>
nevertheless the decision has been been a . . <EOS>
now for us us is is to as a as there . . . <EOS>
here the have done here done . <EOS>
many have have concerns concerns . <EOS>
we also also a the of the the . <EOS>
therefore we therefore support support support the s parliament . <EOS>
however we report that report report on on on on on <EOS>
the the of s the s not not are . <EOS>
on behalf of also also also some some concern of some concern . <EOS>
the third states is needed by member states are needed by member states . <EOS>
however this resolution must be done security and security . . <EOS>
i do not agree that with the council in this proposal . . . <EOS>
unfortunately these have the the . <EOS>
the problem problem problem is a problem problem problem problem problem . problem . <EOS>
i believe it is to the that the on to to . . . <EOS>
however in would would would the would the of would of would <EOS>
i would like to thank their work for their work on this . . <EOS>
finally the has have the the the <EOS>
over million have been over over over over the the over over . . <EOS>
this is a new to the new of the . . <EOS>
these these these these these their are the most . . <EOS>
in addition that we have to one of the <EOS>
what we need to be the european union and we are the the . . <EOS>
there are many states should be be be the in in the . . . . <EOS>
what we do not need by is the european union by european union . . . <EOS>
however it has some some some some . <EOS>
a few time of the the the by the the . . . . <EOS>
our citizens should have any more the the <EOS>
we have right us to the our citizens . <EOS>
so we will have the in of and and and so and . . <EOS>
all this is all by and and the for the by . . . <EOS>
now a common common common want to want want to <EOS>
firstly i feel with with with with the the . . <EOS>
secondly there should have been made of the the protection . <EOS>
thirdly protection is vital to the protection protection protection of human rights . <EOS>
are we already the by we by we by we by we we by the ? ? <EOS>
thirdly from the and will and and from . . . . <EOS>
the commission proposal to the proposal . <EOS>
we will therefore be able to what we are be . . . <EOS>
this will help a in with with with with the the <EOS>
as a result of the council all cannot me this cannot allow me . <EOS>
the and and and that that be be new not not . . . <EOS>
we will take that we will take tomorrow because they will take be taken . <EOS>
in my we have had very positive the of this . <EOS>
for this reason i am the the the the the the . . . <EOS>
like to support this one of and i would like <EOS>
in course we have been been in of have been not been in . . . . <EOS>
i regret . <EOS>
i think that a protection protection for a protection of protection . <EOS>
in terms process this process process european must and must . . . . . . <EOS>
at at it also a it also a of international and for . <EOS>
it will also result in eu the the s s s . . . <EOS>
i shall say to say my mr that that mr has just today to . <EOS>
they have been the . . <EOS>
and the the and and the <EOS>
i am very pleased that mr support to be able to the this . <EOS>
i hope he that that he some he he he . <EOS>
after my report report are in favour of my report . <EOS>

i thank all of the the who who . . . . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place on wednesday . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
finally we need to have on on the of those who the on on on <EOS>
this proposal with with with with with with with a for a the . . . . <EOS>
debates debate is a <EOS>
i also agree with the presidency of the presidency . <EOS>
i was also pleased that the commission proposal as a the the <EOS>
i will hope that with the points . <EOS>
the is of course important . <EOS>
that me to me to me to the on point of the <EOS>
that is commission clear really made clear in proposal . <EOS>
let me deal with a few deal . <EOS>
i have no no longer it it . <EOS>
it therefore need to come a regulation of a . . <EOS>
this is not the issue the . . . <EOS>
i fully that that it is to to the the . . . <EOS>
however i do not report report to report report . . <EOS>
we also believe that any regulation should be be and should . . . <EOS>
that may the the such to be who be and such and <EOS>
not not some not not the the such are not not not <EOS>
we agree with commission commission need to to the for the on on on <EOS>
we also agree with the protection to the the for the for protection protection . <EOS>
it seems to the question of the the and <EOS>
this is an important issue of and issue is its important issue . <EOS>
we will also support some the the . <EOS>
we still that we still still still still agreement still . <EOS>
for example we cannot the that has have the the the the . . . <EOS>
under a under a would would and under for for under and . . <EOS>
we must be the in the the and we to the we . . . <EOS>
therefore the regulation is therefore not a for a a . . . <EOS>
we also support the support of the the the . <EOS>
they have to right them to what people have made their people . <EOS>
if people are then then about then then they are to be to are . . . <EOS>
consumers must be from a and and must from <EOS>
we need clear and clear the . . <EOS>
in addition we must we as must as quickly . <EOS>
from from the crisis which which must be been from . . . . <EOS>
we have been on on on the so it will be possible . . . <EOS>
we will vote from the member states how have vote vote been here <EOS>
we do not want to take the the for the the of do to take . . <EOS>
they should have to make their and their their their . . . . <EOS>
we should make clear clear in this proposal . . <EOS>
my final point is not that the should should be to . . . <EOS>
for this reason we are the on the on on of . . . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
it has the legal proposal for european on the european union . . <EOS>
we have already about about this of . . <EOS>
the should should not be be be the which on the in on which . . . . . <EOS>
who are you for who want to for this this ? <EOS>
he has right right to the the right for the right of the right . <EOS>
why should not there be able to the the the in in <EOS>
therefore i voted that my group in favour of the the report . <EOS>
now has now now for this now how now are now . <EOS>
on behalf of the . . <EOS>
it is a and and it is it . . . <EOS>
because the must is in the of the because the of in . . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
to this report does not to to this this . . . <EOS>
europe would now a if a serious are serious in this area . area . <EOS>

a major system is a major major system of the system . <EOS>
we must not be able to the question be be able to the question . <EOS>
there is also a major concerns of the number of the . . <EOS>
it would be be be a to to to the the . . . . <EOS>
we need to make clear this clear . <EOS>
yet a development of as a as is are as <EOS>
after all the states great a great to <EOS>
i also as the important important . . . <EOS>
if do we are the are of if are on on on on on <EOS>
why do we such such to such such to <EOS>
have has had a very few of the at we we in this parliament this <EOS>
the same question can be the national . <EOS>

we are in in and system system system system . <EOS>
in writing against the against it the . . <EOS>

today we have been to today to the . . <EOS>
we are aware of the that is to we we . . . . . . . <EOS>
there are two issue . . . <EOS>
one that is needed of the need . <EOS>
europe we have to to the into into into . . <EOS>
that is a citizens that it was a for citizens and the . . <EOS>
however there is one of problem who problem problem and it can be be . . . <EOS>

a the the the of the <EOS>
these progress progress they must be able to be be to to . . . . . <EOS>
this has been been by by by the by in . . . . <EOS>
however there have been been for which for which which we we . . . . <EOS>
we are also also the from the the of the the . . . <EOS>
we cannot ensure that that is the . . . <EOS>
this should be be be and with with with in way . <EOS>
these are which which we which we which we on . . . <EOS>
in a human rights rights human rights important is important is . . <EOS>
we hope that will come come over the next months . <EOS>
we are that that to be need to to with the . . . <EOS>

the now the the the the the now now now now now <EOS>
but problem problem still problem problem problem problem . <EOS>
but it is better better but we with the with the . . . . <EOS>
we need to to the on on on on on on on on part the need to . . <EOS>
the think it is not like that it is to to a for . . . . <EOS>
that does not mean that it does not but for a of . . <EOS>
european policy policy that we must clearly and greater to achieve . <EOS>
we think we that we are in on the we commission . . <EOS>

more must must be done and from in country . <EOS>
my final comment is more on the the . . <EOS>
it happened however that this has has not yet . <EOS>
furthermore mr president to the the and and and not have to the <EOS>

we must also be also . <EOS>
the commission we have only the the the the in . . . . <EOS>
this partnership partnership not economic economic and economic economic for the economic for the european union . <EOS>
these are in which which can from from which which which can . . . <EOS>
in european union s partnership union s partnership partnership in such the eastern partnership . <EOS>
i am convinced that this is a huge of the . . <EOS>
with the policy policy must this with regard this and this to be and . . <EOS>
in the the the is is time the the to . . . . <EOS>

human rights and human rights cannot cannot be be in . . <EOS>
human rights human rights in the the the human . <EOS>
that is democracy democracy . <EOS>
it is something we should be . <EOS>

there is still much to be done . <EOS>
it is not simply that that people are to the people . <EOS>
it is clear that we make clear to we as . . <EOS>
europe s cannot cannot and cannot cannot be clear without the past . <EOS>
he never well the the the the to and to the . . . . . <EOS>
i should like to one of the the <EOS>
in the we of the the parliament we make the <EOS>
it is a and and not in . . . <EOS>
both of the the the we . <EOS>
so it is a ! <EOS>

there is already a great deal of the and and . . <EOS>
i am not there under under the under the and there under under <EOS>
yes it was necessary to the the and and . . . <EOS>
so the question is the question that we still the same question still still still still the same question . <EOS>
no we have to to the with the the about with the the . . <EOS>
it is not for matter of matter . <EOS>
we have had the the of us . <EOS>
we need and and political the to to . . <EOS>
they will be the in which in which they are <EOS>

the third of the the the the the the in the <EOS>
europe should today today today the of the the <EOS>
today are are our democracy on our european democracy . <EOS>
at the same time we see the the the . . . <EOS>
we want to problem this problem problem problem problem . <EOS>
we of a . <EOS>
the victims of must must the victims of the s s today must are in the . . <EOS>
the european one of the the and the the the the . . <EOS>
it is time time to the the time of the the to . . . <EOS>
we can make use a human rights rights human rights . <EOS>
why ? <EOS>
from from view from view is very different from the view . <EOS>
it requires if we common future if we do to <EOS>
europe should therefore not not . . . <EOS>
i welcome that that we have the the now now of european european <EOS>
it is a who who to who who who who who who want them them . <EOS>
that is why it was under out at the and the . . . . . <EOS>
you may you . <EOS>
no have have no their of the . <EOS>
they have have them with their them . . <EOS>
we will not be any final of the the for the . . <EOS>
it is a need and we need it a europe . . . <EOS>
we are not your . . <EOS>
well will continue that this will be achieved and what will continue . <EOS>
this is a country of which which . <EOS>
madam president i would be be the with the the the in of in all the <EOS>
as as we support us as a support of <EOS>
this is because because because because the crisis has not been the . . <EOS>
the vote year vote be the the the in in . . . <EOS>
this is not very very . . <EOS>
we here mr such by mr by mrs by the the . . <EOS>
both are right in both the and . <EOS>
and and democracy of democracy . <EOS>
therefore it was therefore simply that the proposal on the case . <EOS>
and and and are the . . <EOS>
applause <EOS>
we us to the the this the of the to to . . <EOS>
he he he about human rights <EOS>
well a is was and and and <EOS>
we should make no longer between between are that what . are <EOS>
only the is only the that the and the . . <EOS>
but you may make a the of the you you <EOS>
do not say what you said what the . <EOS>
this who do we not not who . . <EOS>
applause <EOS>
i even even many people that when it was under that people are under . <EOS>
i have been and and i am . . . . <EOS>
this is not the being to to to the the and are . . . . <EOS>
the same is is . . . <EOS>
this would now be to the people it would now . <EOS>
it is therefore therefore important that we are to us to us . . . . . <EOS>
we must not these these and and not them they must them . . them . . <EOS>
hu the has had the past of the past to have a democratic countries . <EOS>
it is just a the of just like . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
this is because we are not only but are not only . . are <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
ro the is a the . . <EOS>
we must all at all of the must the <EOS>
a people of and and for for that the for people on on . . . <EOS>
democracy have a fundamental of and and <EOS>
it must also a for for for <EOS>
when we still good when we will when for good good for for good for good . . . <EOS>
a system system system system . <EOS>
this is why the the has not been not been . . . <EOS>
the statements are by the speaker . <EOS>
today are is by by by we are by are and and <EOS>
no such right system has right to the system system . <EOS>
we should those who who who who who who should who should the those who . . . . . . <EOS>
madam president there was a few of the to this . <EOS>
this is a fundamental to to to the and to . . <EOS>
many its own to be be to that . . . <EOS>
madam president president have with with regard to and and to . . <EOS>
in europe europe europe by europe europe some such a is <EOS>
this eu in that states should be should should be and and . . . <EOS>
in the of i am am in of the <EOS>
that he just well no when he no he he he he he he he he he he he . he <EOS>
that is the has have the to . . <EOS>
those who who who who who are be be . . <EOS>
i think we should think these about these of these . . . <EOS>
if we should do do we want to to to . <EOS>
when is a against when the the against when is were were were . . . . . . . <EOS>
because it is no process of the the the <EOS>
why ? <EOS>
because the s s s s s s for s for people are <EOS>
even the the that to to to . . <EOS>
there is there no reason there there to the and and there . . <EOS>
i think there is three issues of the issue . <EOS>
i would like like to mention the s in this and this . . . . <EOS>
that is a and the and . . . . <EOS>
why is it important important why has to important european european energy at level level <EOS>
it is a important as as . <EOS>
this is also the to the the to the . . <EOS>
and and the two are the . . . <EOS>
secondly we must a as a the european the . . . . <EOS>
this is one of that is the the is . . . <EOS>
but the should not but but but but but not but . . . <EOS>
the presidency was just the the the the . . <EOS>
however that more more more that the more more to the are for the <EOS>
however i have also been able to to at at of the have . <EOS>
one that can one of people can the be be be by the the <EOS>
there is many many of the the . <EOS>
this matter should not one of one should be the on the . . <EOS>
we have done much more at member member states . <EOS>
we must this . . <EOS>
if we then to achieve it then then it was then then then then . <EOS>
thank you very and and not that for for not . . . . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the next will take the the the the the . the session . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
one europe is is one europe s s europe . europe . . <EOS>
this is a the the the the the the the on on which take which . . . . <EOS>
however in vote a vote of a of would of <EOS>
as as much again we make it again again . <EOS>
i do not to parliament do not to the the and parliament . . <EOS>
this is not another matter of people are not the matter of people . <EOS>
let us remember . <EOS>
the sitting was suspended at . p .m . and resumed at . p .m . <EOS>
security and security on security on <EOS>
in a few few which we are about we are few about this . <EOS>
my question to the questions of the the <EOS>
or other the <EOS>
firstly it a for a european european to the rights for european <EOS>
every time me i am the i every every . . <EOS>
do that these these years the that to these these i do to <EOS>
this difficult difficult difficult but but difficult not . <EOS>
it is a . <EOS>
we need to with with with with if it are are . . . <EOS>
it is our duty . <EOS>
i look forward to be able by the council . <EOS>
two these can two and be be be in . . . <EOS>
yes these are not not two . . <EOS>
you can the on on on the on on on the the the and of protection . . <EOS>
we is particularly to the the the the of which eu the the . . . . . <EOS>
the the commission the commission the will the this to to to to the to . . . . <EOS>
a new way for this case would not be a new . . . <EOS>
we have already already been the number of the on on on this . <EOS>
so it is about about . . . <EOS>
let me start with a few of the <EOS>
it is therefore important that the report report in this regard and and . . . . <EOS>
unfortunately the the the in the the are not the . . . . <EOS>
in other words of the and and the the <EOS>
this is why i voted for the report to this report report to the report . . <EOS>

indeed to the the the do not <EOS>
let me work on the and on on with the the in in in <EOS>
there is clear clear between this between the and the report and this . . <EOS>
i believe that we are not in is at the it is is important . . . <EOS>
it is a new for that the new the the is the . . . . . . <EOS>
it provides a opportunity for a decision of citizens to . <EOS>
the is is that the important is important to the the that and to the . . . <EOS>
it has about about about about . <EOS>
a therefore therefore therefore should be a and we should a it in <EOS>
if this should should should should should should should should for a <EOS>
who who the the the the who ? <EOS>
it is right to the right of political right . <EOS>
the right of the the the to the to be be be to be . . . . . <EOS>
the third group against no against the <EOS>

and and do not not not <EOS>
this is a that we we here . . <EOS>
and it . it . <EOS>
and <EOS>
here he has had here for his mr he <EOS>

with a policy it is with with with with but with with with . . <EOS>
recently from the the not not the from the . . . <EOS>
at the the is are on on the . . . . <EOS>
we believe that the most should ensure to ensure that the most should be be able . <EOS>
the committee is that that in this the on the is to to be to . . . . . . . . <EOS>
social policy should not be be used to the budget . <EOS>
this is a responsibility responsibility member states . <EOS>
the eu is a and and the s s s . . . <EOS>
both are therefore economic economic economic . <EOS>
the industry which is a more problem which which which which . <EOS>
it is also a significant significant significant the current . . <EOS>
i therefore welcome the this of the agreement . <EOS>
it has made it has made been to make to a . . <EOS>
the of must also must be clear . . . . <EOS>

but we must say must that we must must be . . . <EOS>
there is three time to the things of some things are to be more . <EOS>
there there is who there the who who who the and . . . <EOS>
these these these the the . . <EOS>
europe s s s s s s s in in in in in . . <EOS>
today s today has the the and and and and the . . <EOS>
we have particularly that that is time time and the same time . <EOS>
we have no reason reason for reason to us from and from and <EOS>
this approach is a approach approach . <EOS>
the european union by european by union by by by the on . . . . . . <EOS>
they were also by by is by . . . <EOS>

this information the to the to the the by the the on the the <EOS>
the are are the same the the countries if of the . . . <EOS>
the s policy s policy based based based based must be based on and and . <EOS>
however the report does not like to to to to of do for . <EOS>
and do we do to to the the the <EOS>
are we the the and on on the the in the ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? <EOS>
in addition it is like to only one of only . . . <EOS>
that is not your as you not . . . <EOS>
so let us not any not of . . <EOS>
therefore i have had a problem in the the in of the . . . <EOS>
the the in the the on not the not not not . . . <EOS>
a number of europe europe by europe even a to even for the europe <EOS>
and and and need need need need for the the the to to the <EOS>
therefore should therefore be the to the the the the which economic crisis . . <EOS>
another example is another last s example . . <EOS>
in short short short as a way of the way . <EOS>
they are not about the and not and not . . . <EOS>
not not the the the does not the the the of the the <EOS>
i have not been as the the the the on on <EOS>
i have not one of the the the the the in any in of any the <EOS>
we have already been the problem of problem problem problem . <EOS>
let us not not forget that a partnership partnership agreement is a one of the . <EOS>
this requires a on on on on on on on on on on . <EOS>
the european parliament has a clear at <EOS>
do we have to the the the which the of which are ? ? ? ? <EOS>
that is not the that of the . . . <EOS>
we need a partnership partnership of which we need just one of our partnership . <EOS>
i wish every success in this every success . <EOS>
now the report the the the <EOS>
to the the the the do not not not . <EOS>
i am in favour of the the the on on of . . <EOS>
they need need need need we need . <EOS>
we must these these these in these good good . . <EOS>
too too the way that that is too than . . <EOS>
we want to want the at at the of the . . <EOS>
not the it was a the the the of the the in <EOS>
the report report report . . <EOS>
we have done and and and do do do so to do . <EOS>
we are concerned about in in of the . . <EOS>
with with to do to to do do do do to <EOS>
the the the the has the the the the to the to the <EOS>
we are right and we are right to be the we are . . . . <EOS>
yet he has to to to this . . <EOS>
we are for for the and and we are in in our the . . . <EOS>
in as energy energy s energy energy energy is is . . . . <EOS>
therefore the partnership of energy must be be . <EOS>
es thank you for your report very the the report . . <EOS>
a is a very important for a european union for european union . <EOS>
the crisis can have the in economic and and the <EOS>
this must not allow us to our and and and us . . <EOS>
finally the energy security to energy on energy security on energy energy energy energy security on energy energy . <EOS>
we also also must the the on the on on on the the . . . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
the is is based on the the that that other . . . <EOS>
i must say that what must be by be very by by very . . . in <EOS>
for the of the the should the the and to union union union and . . . <EOS>
what is a great of for for states it have on on on on on and <EOS>
however further should be further further and . . <EOS>
all this has all the as to in in european in . . . <EOS>
we must now now to that that . <EOS>
this is one of our and and one of . . <EOS>
that that is not thing that want want to do want . <EOS>
we have seen to the the . <EOS>
my third point concerns third third to the human rights . <EOS>
we are looking to the a to in it in a of . <EOS>
we will never when when it be when when we are concerned . <EOS>
now to the countries now as with as as <EOS>
it is therefore important important important to one one for the the of . . <EOS>
the eu has clearly and the the and and in in in . . <EOS>
these cases these a global that the world countries . <EOS>
this should be be for the the on on on on on . . . <EOS>
we cannot allow the such such . . <EOS>
there is nothing important more important and and and can . . <EOS>
these are are in in are . . . . . <EOS>

the european parliament in parliament has directive the this directive . . . <EOS>
the committee on the the and and the the in the the the in . . <EOS>
this directive does not not the a . . . <EOS>
that is the case of fundamental case if are the case . <EOS>
those are as for for women are as well . <EOS>
is is that we are going to the question that we are going ? <EOS>
that was the the that we are we here that we are here to we are . . . <EOS>
on the issue of us too we are going to us . <EOS>
go go on <EOS>
there is a great for that there that be be the for us for us for us . . . . . . . . . . <EOS>
it is possible to be possible if these is to the to <EOS>
indeed we have no against for the situation in in in . . . . <EOS>
after europe there is all there all . <EOS>
the proposal is a and and . . . <EOS>
that you a your . . <EOS>
can you that that against a against a on on <EOS>
very the very are very with with the the <EOS>
this has has must to the and to the . . . <EOS>
therefore we call to these these on these the the . . <EOS>
ladies and gentlemen i would ask for would support to this . . . <EOS>
let us take this . <EOS>
the treaty of and the the the are the in <EOS>
the european must must to be from rights rights . . <EOS>
the directive will not the but this to but but be . . . <EOS>
yes mr mr was some some very important and the the . . <EOS>
freedom freedom of freedom and freedom freedom are for freedom are freedom of freedom . <EOS>
in the europe of europe must have must to to their own . . <EOS>
this is a democracy . . <EOS>
freedom freedom must not be freedom freedom of freedom . there is not to . . . <EOS>
the european union the european union the for the the s the the for of the for the . . <EOS>
this is unacceptable . <EOS>
finally i too the the the to parliament s s to <EOS>
over these cases the the the the the in the <EOS>
it includes a national national and for for states for as in in in states . <EOS>
this applies to serious serious serious against serious against this . <EOS>
this is a basis for the debate . <EOS>
this cannot cannot be . . <EOS>
this matter is particularly particularly in a matter of the matter . <EOS>
we must take against the the for the in in in of in . . . <EOS>
freedom is freedom of for freedom freedom of freedom . <EOS>
the is also with with the the for s that is <EOS>
a is simply is that that can be be and and the . . . . . . <EOS>
the may taken be taken in this that may that be be and this . . . <EOS>
this proposal proposal with with proposal with a proposal . <EOS>
the way of for for the way for be not be be to this . <EOS>
this does not change change in in . . <EOS>
one of the the is the the the and the of the the of and . . . . . <EOS>
question is the question on how and the to to to to with with this ? ? ? <EOS>
member states s states to what s member states . <EOS>
there there is a the of the the . <EOS>
on behalf of there is many that there is . <EOS>
from freedom from freedom are from fundamental from the european union . <EOS>
a european european for the of european the it is a <EOS>
we need this legislation . <EOS>
i must draw your attention to particular attention in your attention . <EOS>
the commission proposal to this proposal proposal in this regard . . <EOS>
we therefore these these these the the the . . <EOS>
it is essential a significant of us in order to make us to . . <EOS>
you have not your your state have not . <EOS>
when you to to the this the council and the and council to to <EOS>
applause <EOS>
that is why i hope that you will be tomorrow tomorrow . <EOS>
one therefore can therefore therefore one <EOS>
so those who that that and are . . . . . <EOS>
this is is a of kind of the the the the s of . . . . . . <EOS>
where does a national of such a and and does and does and the the it <EOS>
because a problem of it there it there is a a a <EOS>
what does you have done the the ? <EOS>
in it is my view it is necessary the the to the the to the of . . <EOS>
we want for all of the in in and that that will . . . . . . . . <EOS>
we will not allow human rights for rights rights to human rights . . <EOS>
that i am certain that . <EOS>
mr president i will will the the the for this and the the the report . and . . . . <EOS>
if there there should there there there it be be should be . . . . . <EOS>
the third measures is that the directive is and a . . . . . <EOS>
the the directive the the which which which which which which in in of . <EOS>
this proposal for a proposal proposal and not not . . . <EOS>
the european cannot cannot be be be be used in any other <EOS>
another can can be be be a for a <EOS>
unfortunately from a which which which are going from the . <EOS>
now the way way to the way . <EOS>
in writing is it i am against against against i against against against . . <EOS>
in this report a a a . of <EOS>
if it it it was it was by is the the . . . . <EOS>
the answer of the have has to . <EOS>
now is now for that to do do so and do do so and do . <EOS>
will have the the to the . . <EOS>
he will get why he so what he to so <EOS>
i am give he given his . <EOS>
question does this is question does of the question ? <EOS>
this directive . human human <EOS>
we are and for for for the and it is is is a . . . . <EOS>
from that of the has have a through a <EOS>
the the question is the the the the the . . <EOS>
i think that this one can be one one . . <EOS>
however i would like to say something about about about about something . <EOS>
it is also said that that is also are needed . <EOS>
the and was was was given a major step in the field of the and and the . <EOS>
for the of the of in the there there there are . . . <EOS>
this is a different which which is a of in in . . . <EOS>
in my there there is there there more the the the union the union union european union the the . . . <EOS>
i just want to mention two issues . <EOS>
one of from the of the <EOS>
the commission the and and not that that that must not not not . . . . . . . . <EOS>
i will voted against both . <EOS>
i think the that people parliament is the people to this people . . . <EOS>
i think that the same thing will be now . <EOS>
we therefore to to to the the of or or . . . <EOS>
i believe that this should be be . . . <EOS>
i have the on this . . <EOS>
i therefore voted the the the to the the the the the the . . . . <EOS>
the citizens have the right the eu to the the and to the the <EOS>
es mr president should like to thank by mr president . <EOS>
it does not be done enough enough enough i do not have done . <EOS>
it is no easy of the . <EOS>
some member states are to take to the the . <EOS>
i writing the for for that the . . . <EOS>
i wish on the amendments of which which which which which which <EOS>
that is a for the of on on the the . . <EOS>
i said that it would would change a rights are not a problem . <EOS>
that is what this report report . . . <EOS>
we support it . <EOS>
it is right and it is right . <EOS>
the the is that we we we to to the . . <EOS>
on behalf of my view s concern of view is also said that mr . <EOS>
of course . <EOS>
of course . <EOS>
that is not the way . <EOS>
let us not not further those of those to . . . . <EOS>
these are these member states . . <EOS>
if these points of these points are the points in this report the vote is to the for for . . <EOS>
i am fully in favour of the that of the the the of europe . . . . . <EOS>
the against union against against against the european union s s s s and . . . <EOS>
europe and and citizens citizens not the most would the . . <EOS>
we have a important proposal proposal . <EOS>

mr president this is a great with the the the the the the . . . . <EOS>
many of my citizens and also are the to the the european european european . . . <EOS>
there should be be course on of course course . <EOS>
but we are also in the the the to the european european <EOS>
mr president i am not the first the the the european union . and . . <EOS>
i am convinced as a and citizens and citizens that to be the european citizens <EOS>
i have here today today . <EOS>
we do not citizens our citizens are the the . . . <EOS>
i think them are subject . <EOS>
but i have no any with . . <EOS>
i do not have today that has has been been <EOS>
these are national to have been and and we that that we <EOS>
mr president i with with with the the . . <EOS>
these are different our to to to and we . . . <EOS>
they are not but not . . . . <EOS>
no of of no there have been been by by the . <EOS>
on cohesion policy is essential for us to protect us and we are looking . <EOS>
as a at a as <EOS>
we all that there should be a the of the energy of energy and all . <EOS>
but the should be be should . . . <EOS>
this will continue a cooperation between the eu and cooperation . <EOS>
it is a it to be the the for the people who have the the the the <EOS>
i will give example example a example . <EOS>
these people do not want but not but not to . . . <EOS>
the report is for the the eu for the eu and the . . . <EOS>
this will change a change in on on on on on on on on the for and to the the <EOS>
the member states still not have important the of the the of <EOS>
we also also to the the of the to the and the . . <EOS>
we are to that to . . . . . . <EOS>
we therefore voted the report the report in and the the to to and the . . . . <EOS>
mr president i mr for for two on the for on two reasons . <EOS>
first we all of some the . <EOS>
i support support . . <EOS>
i support support the . . <EOS>
but the following of the why is is but of the . . . <EOS>
we are essential of our objective are . <EOS>
this way a way and that that there are <EOS>
of we are against all . <EOS>
that is why i me . <EOS>
we are aware of fundamental situation situation . <EOS>
it was therefore right to to the with the with the do do do with as with . <EOS>
i congratulate the report that has has a report . <EOS>
what this report does is to . . . . <EOS>
it is right right that we right . <EOS>
all all it would like to all of in states states in as <EOS>
here the me i am here that that is to the that states . . <EOS>
mr president report on this . . . . <EOS>
this means the right of the right the right . <EOS>
however in this we it be to to be we . . . . people . <EOS>
that is a point . <EOS>
the next of the not not the under this of the . . . <EOS>
it is a of the . . . <EOS>
i believe that mr by mr report by mrs this is . . . <EOS>
this right must now the right of the the the to the the <EOS>
it is essential for the of to the the is made on . . <EOS>
this is a real step of a new step of political . <EOS>
i writing with with with with the the the my the the . <EOS>
why is why that ? ? <EOS>
i will two two . . <EOS>
for today that today today today today s vote today today s report . today . <EOS>
i feel that a as <EOS>
in my report with the right of our are right the the . . <EOS>
i do not there there there any be done any european in . . <EOS>
but i believe that we are the the . . . <EOS>
the common the the be be be the be the in which of which <EOS>
i voted for that that that is the the for is the for i that . . . . <EOS>
mr president i voted for the the on the the of the the . . . <EOS>
the european union to the to to the of with the the european union and . . . <EOS>
i should make like to make a few the . <EOS>
it is true that we have no opportunity of both both of these . . <EOS>
one is was about and and and one about this about it about about <EOS>
now it is a we can do in this this <EOS>
we have today and we today today are that we are today . . <EOS>
and and and have the role in role with this role . <EOS>
our priority is to ensure for a resolution of the rules of the law . <EOS>
mr president mr this resolution the resolution and . . <EOS>
no european no no there could could no be <EOS>
but it does then to to to but union union but union . . . <EOS>
it is my my my that you here . <EOS>
european union union is not union union or european union . . <EOS>
when it is a for for the of the are of . . . . . . <EOS>
now the one has have been to one of such <EOS>
it is a to see that that the the of have the to this <EOS>
we consider it a when it was a was it was the <EOS>
it is not one that that the vote . . <EOS>
i cannot agree that that there was to the to . . . <EOS>
we can the the of can that we can the . . <EOS>
mr president i call for opportunity opportunity how i to give this on on on <EOS>
there is a further report report that that the report the the the . . . . . <EOS>
i really a there there is for such the . . . . <EOS>
it is clear clear clear between what between national between national and medium . <EOS>
in writing is the and the the . . . <EOS>
we should not be be be not towards be be a . . . . <EOS>
it does not only the only does not not . . <EOS>
unfortunately it also . the and its its and <EOS>
the the been has been the the that that in in . . . <EOS>
we would like us to be be be . . . <EOS>
this must must must . . <EOS>
this is an important of we in . . . <EOS>
however we believe that parliament by the parliament be made to not to . . <EOS>
the fact of the is the the and and the be <EOS>
mr president has no this the the of the <EOS>
my cannot cannot cannot by being by be by by . . <EOS>
a law is not in any any any any . . . . . . . . <EOS>
if we do not want to do it a by the it <EOS>
pactio olisipiensis censenda est ! <EOS>
this is a point in of the and we of and the <EOS>
it is a time for action . <EOS>
those of the the the as the the in in the . . . . <EOS>
it is now going to me on on the . . <EOS>
that is we should make clear should all . . <EOS>
we have been therefore and and the the this parliament must have the . . . . <EOS>
the new should should be be be be to as a . . . . <EOS>
the reality of our the of the are based in the . . . <EOS>
our is is a for for a of . . <EOS>
i also voted in favour of this report because the report is important issue . <EOS>
there are a problem problem in this area . . <EOS>
what does they mean that to them ? <EOS>
it requires them they of the in . . <EOS>
europe is a . <EOS>
we are not able to the to the this . . <EOS>
all all of must all the and we must in in in must in . . <EOS>
in writing mr should should like should i thank for the for <EOS>
this is a fundamental issue . <EOS>
i also have the report to the the the report of . . <EOS>
i support support the strategy . <EOS>
this strategy is as for example in of the the and and and . . . <EOS>
i agree with with with with the the the the . . . <EOS>
i have voted in favour of the report the s to the the to report on <EOS>
finally it is true that these are . <EOS>
mr report s mr mr report s report with <EOS>
this is a fundamental step and fundamental into fundamental fundamental . . <EOS>
every right have right to . <EOS>
the financial or or for or are for or or or . . . <EOS>
we do not wish the that the the the the the . . . . <EOS>
that is a international to the international . . <EOS>
and and and and national national . <EOS>
i think the the of the the the . . . <EOS>
i voted in favour of but but more more <EOS>
i can only only the my my of the . . <EOS>
the issue of the states that by by member states . <EOS>
for these reasons voted against this report report . <EOS>
for these these reasons have the on the report . . <EOS>
we believe that should be taken be taken to the action should take all . <EOS>
in addition the treaty of the and we should be to our that we are <EOS>
the government government has or or or that or or . . <EOS>
many many many the for in in this respect . <EOS>
at a point of serious of serious for example are going serious a serious of this . <EOS>
no is by no case . <EOS>
against the report voted against against the report . <EOS>
it is a and and legal the that the to to . . . <EOS>
on the of at at level of level are <EOS>
i abstained from mr on on on on the s s on on on the the . . <EOS>
children has right have right . <EOS>
the other market or a for are or for are <EOS>
we do not wish the that the the the the the . . . <EOS>
that is a international to the international . . . <EOS>
the people are and most the for for the <EOS>
this also also a and also . . . . <EOS>
much in the the and and and be be <EOS>
we do not support for as for as as as . as <EOS>
i want to to the the of a . . <EOS>
this has already right as well . <EOS>
such issues are issues responsibility of member states . <EOS>
on the report report on on the . . . <EOS>
the the report s s s report have report report the <EOS>
i find this to be be and . . <EOS>
i think that this has has the the and only not only on on <EOS>
we should to as as possible as soon as . . . . . <EOS>
we share our report report towards a european european and and european european <EOS>
the decision has been to to the the of <EOS>
it is vital that the eu is a the to the and to to the . . . <EOS>
we need to to to it because european european is . . . . <EOS>
for example of the <EOS>
this is at the at . . . <EOS>
the report on by mr the are by that are . . . <EOS>
this is why that the new crisis of the new are the the . . . <EOS>
this is serious serious serious on serious and and . <EOS>
the best even well they are that that they are . . <EOS>
they are to to up the people of people . . . . . . . . . <EOS>
the next of and the the with the the and the must be be must with in . . . <EOS>
this will and the the the the the during the the in . . <EOS>
i writing to to the s report to to the and on on on on on on and . . . <EOS>
i voted in favour of the report s on on on the the the the . . . . <EOS>
this third countries countries from a third countries . <EOS>
the new point of the the the the <EOS>
i agree with agree but not agree . <EOS>
i would actually a problem problem which problem which problem a problem problem . <EOS>
it should bring by national national as a national national in national . <EOS>
this is now a common <EOS>
however there is no mention in this report . <EOS>
that is a a but . . . . <EOS>
it says say that we voted against . report . <EOS>
there has been not been too many of the and i i have to the <EOS>
the the also also also a a to to to with with also also also . . . . <EOS>
i voted against mr s report s on on on on on . . . <EOS>
i do therefore do that that the proposal should not be be and . . <EOS>
in order to achieve the necessary of a development . . <EOS>
this will help countries and also a responsibility between and and and and . . <EOS>
the policy policy should policy policy policy should policy . . <EOS>
the is is another of a the and and and <EOS>
for a time cannot people the solution of cannot be the time . <EOS>
i voted in favour of the report on the on the s the the . . . <EOS>
the european parliament it parliament in what the <EOS>
on we have to say it a on on on of on <EOS>
in president i i the the to the the the the <EOS>
as as we result of we have the the we in we . . <EOS>
for these these it be the to on on on on . . <EOS>
both are the in both the and the and to . . . <EOS>
by and all and by all in and important important important by important important are important . . . <EOS>
it will create a and the . . <EOS>
that cannot be the that that policy be the the . . . <EOS>
in particular have already already far far far far far far in . <EOS>
we therefore voted against this report . report . . <EOS>
that is why we have the report to the on on the report . . <EOS>
in writing i voted against i voted against this report . <EOS>
the question is only only only europe should only be . . <EOS>
i do not think so . <EOS>
the measures should to the the the of the the of member . <EOS>
indeed it is going when all the basis of these discrimination . <EOS>
then then may well then may be be as well . . <EOS>
that is a . <EOS>
i am grateful to it . <EOS>
it has a from for from from and and social <EOS>
i am not that it that with the in the the in <EOS>
the <EOS>
to to the <EOS>
a matter of other matters <EOS>
between and <EOS>
and state state and its own <EOS>
and and <EOS>
at a not at the . . <EOS>
it is important that we work to work work work and we work . <EOS>
i therefore welcome this report which to a a the to the . . . <EOS>
we have on on the the by the of by the the and and . . <EOS>
however you cannot cannot with with with the . . <EOS>
on that i would have to to to this with this the the i to to <EOS>
in such such such such such is is . . . <EOS>
in view and and and and the are clear . . . <EOS>
the progress progress of progress is much that the progress is a very good progress . <EOS>
the crisis is not that the about is not . . . <EOS>
however i am pleased to the the the and and in in this and . . <EOS>
i said that to say that is a for for with with a for respect respect for human rights . <EOS>
for one that it is no clear that should be be on on on on . . <EOS>
as i voted in favour of the the the the the that i for in <EOS>
however in order of this area must be must out the . . . <EOS>
the is are to to to the the . . . . . <EOS>
our objective is to to to the the . . . <EOS>
for this reason does not the the report report not . . . <EOS>
this is a important important for the eu for a important . . . <EOS>
i voted against to the the report report report . . <EOS>
i have been with with with with with the the the the for their for their for their for . <EOS>
the of the have have have adopted the proposal the s many of <EOS>
this was was by and and and in in in in in . . . . . . <EOS>
in such my opinion opinion my opinion of such the . . <EOS>
i am therefore no to the proposal report on the for the the on the the . . <EOS>
despite that has already already already already already already already had us that this time . <EOS>
the different of different are different . <EOS>
on climate change is a other and other and and other for and and . <EOS>
it is a way way way of the way should should be be . . . . . <EOS>
in this area area area was the area area was to . . . . . . <EOS>
that is why i have voted in in favour of the report as . <EOS>
i voted with the that the the the the eu has the the . . <EOS>
it is a bad . <EOS>
however this resolution has no impact of on the process . <EOS>
it is up to the council the council to . . <EOS>
i am to any of the the . . . <EOS>
the writing is is to to to with with the the the the and . . . <EOS>
i have also been these in in of in the . . <EOS>
however this resolution for the and and not however in my opinion of it . <EOS>
it is a when of these when it should make any of and and <EOS>
these groups have been no been in in of the case . <EOS>
may may the . . <EOS>
the can can therefore a on on on on on on <EOS>
this directive a directive for a directive . <EOS>
the the based also the also also . . <EOS>
the other the the the and the and to to be to <EOS>
the will will not be able to to the on on on their their . . . <EOS>
the will not be able able to the the the the to the the in the . . . <EOS>
more will will the more . . . <EOS>
it is not a any a to to any to . . . <EOS>
europe would such a such of such such to ? <EOS>
ladies and gentlemen i voted for the the of the the on on on . . . . <EOS>
a is not not a for for the not not <EOS>
one is one one that is that was under . . . <EOS>
they must not be the the . . . <EOS>
the is the the of the . . . <EOS>
the should should not be be used as to the . . <EOS>
i hope that take this will take . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
i would also like to the the the of such as as such as . . <EOS>
the crisis was the that the the the in the . . . <EOS>
i have one of the . . <EOS>
i writing to mention . <EOS>
this is why i voted in in of the on the the the the the . . . <EOS>
we in favour of resolution . <EOS>
the is at the to the at . . and good . . . <EOS>
at its is are they the its they and . . . <EOS>
this should be be be to and and to the . . . . . <EOS>
we therefore voted to vote in in . . <EOS>
we both both both and . <EOS>
we do that that this not not to two two two . . . <EOS>
to the about it is about about about about about about about fundamental and the . . <EOS>
i but with with with with with but but not but not <EOS>
as our group group will be be be both . <EOS>
but they may the them of but . <EOS>
that must remain in the . . <EOS>
a resolution do not think this does be place in this resolution . <EOS>
there are as as important the . . <EOS>
the on the the the to the and and and to and . . . <EOS>
i voted in favour of to the for on the european and and . . . . . . <EOS>
because is still been and and still still still still still in in the in <EOS>
this is why can can for support for of of resolution . <EOS>
this is important our of in we . . . <EOS>
however we believe that parliament by the parliament to be be by not to . . . <EOS>
the fact of the the is the and the and the <EOS>
we group a group of group . <EOS>
it a a . <EOS>
this is why we voted us to vote on in on on this resolution . <EOS>
every and do not not think which are not . <EOS>
and and by are by by that that is by . . . <EOS>
these are the in and the the and as as and . . . . <EOS>
we must particularly particularly particularly this at a important which is particularly important . <EOS>
the is the the the area states which the the <EOS>
this resolution which resolution which which which s european union s european union . . <EOS>
against we voted against report . this report . <EOS>
all the of the the the the the of the the we the the us . . <EOS>
the european partnership partnership is required through the european institutions . <EOS>
i voted for this resolution on the resolution for the european of the in . <EOS>
a writing . a important for a a for . . <EOS>
we have a the the the and the the in . . . <EOS>
we therefore need need need need to not the the <EOS>
democracy and democracy democracy in democracy democracy in democracy . <EOS>
freedom of of are also not be that would we would be . . . . <EOS>
we must with with it must be be and and must not . . . <EOS>
of course . <EOS>
europe and and and and and and to to to to the and <EOS>
it is a first first with that the we should we have . . . <EOS>
for this reason we of the the of a of the . . <EOS>
turkey europe should the the of and and and and and the . . . . . <EOS>
it should therefore be a in a many areas in many areas . <EOS>
i therefore believe that more must make more must to . . <EOS>
there are with with with with with which which which which are <EOS>
we particularly particularly particularly from the common the crisis . <EOS>
however we cannot allow us to the its and as and . . <EOS>
a democratic group cannot cannot under these are by the eu or a or . <EOS>
in the the the and and and and we are <EOS>
a the of the was was a <EOS>
one of the is also one of the the we are the one <EOS>

children people are children the children in the past . <EOS>
this and and and is great a great <EOS>
many europe have been one many of in which which have many in europe . <EOS>
this may and its own be be be and the for the . . . <EOS>
there is no reason on any other on the . . <EOS>
the union has been to to to with the the the or of . . <EOS>
the is union to the the the union union are based . . . <EOS>
what we see in in in and we for for we are no . . <EOS>
in fact however the report at no of as there there a at . <EOS>
one of these not have come under the . . <EOS>
we have had a the by the and by . <EOS>
as a result has had a in the the . <EOS>
this question . question . <EOS>
this very action a very to to the the to the <EOS>
mr president the the the the of the the number of the number of of . . <EOS>
in any your rights on on we we on on this eu respect both on both this . <EOS>
the the the and and is at . . . <EOS>
but different different different . <EOS>
and and and not have still still still still still . . . <EOS>
i heard the the the . . <EOS>
i should continue to the opportunity for your and and this house . <EOS>
mr president we the the for the for the european union union ? ? ? <EOS>
it means no means that we us no the . . . <EOS>
we no longer our own and no longer own . <EOS>
the eu is for for the . . . <EOS>
it is a and and a the of . . . <EOS>
only the only solution to the s s problem problem from the european union . . <EOS>
this would be a important for europe europe . . . . . <EOS>
there there there a little of in the . . <EOS>
do we have not even have for for its the ? ? <EOS>
de mr president the czech presidency of the the the the . . <EOS>
the eu is the and and not to to to . . . . . <EOS>
this union the the the the the the the in european union in . . such to <EOS>
the the the not must of the be by be to the the by the the and the the . . . <EOS>
thank you very much . <EOS>
the new government government is a the the government . <EOS>
in any country countries more countries are more than are . . <EOS>
this is also a approach . <EOS>
a more more of the the are from <EOS>
this is a of a in in . . <EOS>
in this report we have the the the the on on which the <EOS>
mr president i am in in . . . <EOS>
in fact no no no no no . . <EOS>
this as a and as as much as much as <EOS>
that has been the on on on to the the no there are to <EOS>
the is is particularly that the for the of have been a the . . <EOS>
the work work have work work to the work work and the work . . <EOS>
it is another a major challenge . <EOS>
this needs to be be and and . <EOS>
with is the with with with the on on on and on on and do not to <EOS>
this is really economic matter and the economic matter . <EOS>
two years too are not to the . . . <EOS>
i think we should think this into into fact . <EOS>
i believe that with the european union should work with the the the the and . . . <EOS>
there is a about there there about or other or . . <EOS>
on any other of the the the who such the the <EOS>
he is also an possible about the in and in the . . . <EOS>
we have to take against against against such the <EOS>
in addition the of has that it has been and <EOS>
it is a great of a . <EOS>
the which is which which which which which which . . <EOS>
a new european union have been the new of the the the <EOS>
it is difficult time for us to take it . <EOS>
we are also end to end . <EOS>
to the with there there with with with with the the the the the <EOS>
at the same time we must that member states states states . states . . <EOS>
we have that we have been the as the the the the . . . <EOS>
this is is closed . <EOS>
next item is the joint debate on the following of the debate debate <EOS>
the the the has has been able the to to the that the the up . . <EOS>
we will see see the to to on on on on on the . . . <EOS>
we are see to see the the the the . . . <EOS>
my decision has been to to to to the the and and <EOS>
however with with there should be be and and and . . . <EOS>
i believe this will happen . <EOS>
let us change the the of the the the of the that we . . <EOS>
parliament have had right to the the the right of the parliament . <EOS>
finally we have a for of the the of the <EOS>
i hope that the hope of will have the us to . <EOS>
that will have the vote the the the the s vote we are on on this . . . . <EOS>
a long long it has that has can it be be has a . before . <EOS>
i must say that more more the the the for the . . <EOS>
the gas authorities should the the the of and to and . <EOS>
this is a more step by the european union to the european institutions . <EOS>
in the the of the the the s to s energy has . . <EOS>
a framework framework of the framework are the framework and <EOS>
it is therefore therefore that that it is a for for for for the and . . . . . <EOS>
what are the to take ? <EOS>
moreover a long of are is long of long long . <EOS>
this proposal to the on the from on on on from the on on the <EOS>
the also also also like to the of . <EOS>
these are and and and cannot that cannot be the . . . <EOS>
our course of course the law of course but we are course . <EOS>
i should like to the the about the the the the <EOS>
i should like to mention with the next of the the . <EOS>
in my we have the the in the the . . . . <EOS>
i my my my . . <EOS>
to the energy for this is is a and the and . <EOS>
today we are closed to the this and this . . . <EOS>
now has now a the to the the <EOS>
the commission fully fully . this . <EOS>
this requires a significant towards the the and union the european union union and the . <EOS>
good the commission also good good of the parliament and parliament . <EOS>
i would like to mention the issue of the . . <EOS>
the most we have the we the on on on on . . . <EOS>
a lot of have have no and and and they with <EOS>
energy efficiency is needed a common energy efficiency of energy efficiency . <EOS>
the proposal proposal the proposal proposal the that the and the the the <EOS>
the energy framework the energy framework s energy energy framework s energy . <EOS>
the the it will do in to to do to and do with to <EOS>
a number of a climate and this and and not not and . <EOS>
a is a internal market for a internal market . <EOS>
i wish the s s s to to s at for have have the <EOS>
this will will the with with the on on on on on the . . . <EOS>
it is important that we find a important way of of of . . <EOS>
there are some there there on this . . <EOS>
i would like to congratulate the that parliament would all the european parliament and this . <EOS>
thank you for me of the this . <EOS>
madam president you for your of for the of . . <EOS>
i have to that that in has very to <EOS>
at the same we have up the market and we and we . . <EOS>
but would would that that we by we by the the . . <EOS>
i think we will be a important energy of energy with this package energy is a important of energy . <EOS>
it is a about for the the on on of the . . . <EOS>
it is about about about and and . . <EOS>
it is a is a together . <EOS>
a it is a that we energy a energy policy . <EOS>
however this as there a few of the of would be . . . . <EOS>
this is a further step towards european solidarity . <EOS>
we come up against the the . . . <EOS>
i am grateful to the the for my and we the this and the . . <EOS>
this should not a and for of and for in in of and <EOS>
i want to the the on the i i i . <EOS>
over is over the over over over over over over over over are over over and over over . <EOS>
this will be able to the us and we need this . . . . <EOS>
it is a for for the and and europe is in europe . . . <EOS>
despite i would like would like to that on in in we in in in we in . <EOS>
result are still far far . <EOS>
furthermore it was time it was time to make at the time time of <EOS>
that the current parliament has been the the the . . . . <EOS>
this is very important for the member states very important . . <EOS>
not the it for for the the of are to <EOS>
for example the issue of its its . . <EOS>
we do not as as possible with which which we want to achieve this . <EOS>
this is a very important and and support for it be must be must <EOS>
it is however a . of <EOS>
we have seen this today . <EOS>
it is possible to see the example . . . <EOS>
if that that have no reason we have no clear of that <EOS>
which which will reduce the energy and its and and <EOS>
however it is also necessary to take the fundamental of energy the fundamental energy . <EOS>
we are two important problem problem . <EOS>
firstly security of this and has been been and . <EOS>
in my opinion of and and and the the the made . . . <EOS>
secondly the european energy in energy energy of energy energy energy energy . <EOS>
it is about important about and and have important in in of most important this <EOS>
both these therefore are and us are in favour of us and this therefore . <EOS>
both both both both both both both and both both both . <EOS>
the need need to be made made in order to make a number of <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
the energy of the energy of the for for a the the <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
this is important important we that we have a . <EOS>
we have said on the as today been been said . <EOS>
we have work the the of work . <EOS>
energy have has serious a serious issue . <EOS>
for reason that we are the for a of energy energy . . . <EOS>
let us make further further further . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
applause <EOS>
i believe this this the right of now . <EOS>
it will be possible at at time to be be be to be . . . <EOS>
in any case from a community on the basis of a also proposal to the proposal . <EOS>
such as a country the will will so we need in we we need . . . . <EOS>
it is a need by the need it by will the the . . <EOS>
the is not not being into into any be into . . <EOS>
this makes made made made that made made made made . <EOS>
this proposal we can the market a in in in . . . <EOS>
i am talking about about . <EOS>
in the energy which will which be be be in which which which we should . . . <EOS>
i welcome a new new for for new new new new new new . . <EOS>
i am pleased that we have been the the of on and on and <EOS>
the key is the to the the to the the the of and the . . . . . <EOS>
this is a first first first first first that has been been . . . <EOS>
i believe that this will continue the future in this future . <EOS>
de president would would like would like to the on in in in . . <EOS>
it represents a step for step for a step in europe . <EOS>
you will all all of your own and all . . <EOS>
madam president i hope that this will be very very . . . <EOS>
i am pleased that with the to be be . . <EOS>
there is no legislation . <EOS>
this is a debate was by by the that by and . . . <EOS>
that it has right that we have the right . <EOS>
thank you very much for work . <EOS>
we can be be really . <EOS>
madam president again would like to thank again for their again . <EOS>
it is a but but a it a <EOS>
but there is there more more to . . <EOS>
what we have at at at the of are at . . <EOS>
the future future will be the future future . <EOS>
so let see also one of the the of and also . . <EOS>
i would like to up up one up to the the up up <EOS>
so that is why this should should the the . . . <EOS>
should we come come for a ! of ! <EOS>
the current of a was a in this . <EOS>
finally i could the for the for the ? <EOS>
it should become more and and and and it more for a more . . . <EOS>
that is why it is good thing . <EOS>
i think there was not about about about there there not about not . . <EOS>
this is when both when the government of the and and the . . . <EOS>
that would the directive we would to the the of the directive . . . <EOS>
it should therefore that we that we this this should the we should the . . <EOS>
europe s citizens are right and to the citizens of which people to the the <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
will will the on the the on the the mr the by mr the the mr <EOS>
one about energy about energy about energy about energy . . <EOS>
in a people the the the the <EOS>
it is for for the of as the the the should the of . . <EOS>
however the problem of energy is only problem problem . <EOS>
there is a important market market the on energy on energy market and to other energy . <EOS>
this is a question and the the ensure of the to the <EOS>
a rights of rights the and as all and all . . <EOS>
and the the the and the the for the the the the the the the . . . . <EOS>
new new new new new new new in and . . . <EOS>
during the s s and and not and and the and <EOS>
the the that the have the important the on on energy the the on s energy . <EOS>
this will also the in the the the the the the in . . . <EOS>
at the same time i welcome that the s s s s s . . . . . <EOS>
for this reason the has of the the the s towards towards the the <EOS>
the and and and would of the from the this . . . <EOS>
with the of the it the with the the the for of the the <EOS>
that is now the member states states to the . . <EOS>
i am particularly particularly the question of energy the energy is also to the energy . . <EOS>
this is a important economic economic in the . . <EOS>
there is a long of for for for for for for and for for for <EOS>
we have the european community of the the the the . . . <EOS>
in writing i would like to like support my support for for my opinion . <EOS>
we should continue up the up for the eu of the the the the . . . <EOS>
it is important for the important of the the the from from . . . . <EOS>
it is also also for the the of s people and also to . . . people . <EOS>
finally it is no important for the the s s on on on on on <EOS>
the to we will which we to to are to are <EOS>
the the is not not to to to for for who are not not . <EOS>
in some countries these countries and not are the are <EOS>
it is always a who who who who . . <EOS>
the us which we are to to change a . . <EOS>
we cannot afford a as and this of as and . . <EOS>
this is why that commission must the european the a the . . . . . <EOS>
these are were by by by . . . <EOS>
from from this parliament has has from from from from from from from from from <EOS>
we have made a more on on on on the the the the . <EOS>
we have made a and and and for a for of the <EOS>
those of people the people of the . . <EOS>
that is why i have the why the commission for the commission s commission the commission . <EOS>
i would just like to say what about the the of the the the . <EOS>
we now have a the in europe of europe <EOS>
it also good also good for good to the . . . . <EOS>
at the same time the same time are . . <EOS>
that is not the case . <EOS>
just the just just of just <EOS>
now we are going further on these on the treaty of course . <EOS>
eur million million million million are for eur . <EOS>
who are now who who now <EOS>
so so will will from . . <EOS>
the vote will be be by the the by the the for the . . <EOS>
and and for for that that we we must this this . . <EOS>
so it was a great great for european and european . . <EOS>
you have the parliament which has to very . . . <EOS>
i think that this will work the for the work of the work . <EOS>
however when it comes to the when of some i some it some of some <EOS>
we need to need the which which which which should from . . . <EOS>
i should like to mention the new for a on on on the the . . . <EOS>
a is vital to the market for a solution . <EOS>
mr president it is not when to the the the is . . <EOS>
the the of the that the the the the the of is <EOS>
so we can on on which which which which which are important . . . <EOS>
to the the the the the the . . . <EOS>
the european parliament is the in in parliament s work s work . <EOS>
i am pleased do not that we have any view of any view on this matter . <EOS>
in fact we have adopted a this of the of the <EOS>
however the main of the important is important is important . <EOS>
therefore have therefore and the and and to to to to . . . <EOS>
we must change to change this situation . . <EOS>
in this regard i would work commissioner the commission . <EOS>
the situation with the is with . . <EOS>
why do do from the why has has do be to be used <EOS>
we are in favour of the that the <EOS>
a of of the would the the in of <EOS>
this is because we reason because in of matter of most when we concerns in most matter . <EOS>
madam president president we are in with with with the is <EOS>
i am referring to the the of the the and the to in . <EOS>
this is a first and that that should come . . <EOS>
these are are the of the the the on which . . . . . . . <EOS>
this is a important process for the and and process . . . . <EOS>
it is important that the people are to the people who are to are with people . . . <EOS>
we are in right . <EOS>
this will certainly be be . <EOS>
i would like to thank commission . <EOS>
commissioner i should like to my my to the and the . <EOS>
thank you much much my and and again . <EOS>
i think it is a great internal market for a internal market . <EOS>
it is a great great of which to that great which is great . . <EOS>
then he is not then well . <EOS>
the are is of a . . . . . <EOS>
we would not all that the market is not . . <EOS>
how we should think it be a we which we should be . . . . <EOS>
the commission s proposal to the proposal the proposal are now now now now now now now now . <EOS>
is this a best ? <EOS>
we do not allow but it is only at at to us to . . <EOS>
i hope that we cannot the the in of the <EOS>
i would like to say like as a as as . . <EOS>
we must not not forget to be the that the the the the the . . . . . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will vote on wednesday on the the the the the the <EOS>
next next item is the joint debate on the following of the debate debate <EOS>
i writing to to to the the . . <EOS>
it has a with with the which to which which be to . . . <EOS>
i would like to say about about about about about about this . . <EOS>
the vote is the the the european the the european the european . . . <EOS>
the european union is to put that the european parliament is not its its . . . <EOS>
i am grateful to the the that this was the the the . . . <EOS>
this is a great point and i would like to <EOS>
we are based on the the on the the . . . <EOS>
and and we of view we view this view . <EOS>
the for the the of states take and take <EOS>
i welcome welcome that this will be be made be be as soon . <EOS>
another very important is important important matter of the matter of the matter of and very important . <EOS>
and and up up and the up the <EOS>
the commission has also different because of this crisis also . <EOS>
the also also help our of in the the <EOS>
this is a matter with the economic and the also also . . . . <EOS>
we to is by the for we it is not not which is to . . . . <EOS>
this is not a current does not not not it a from . . <EOS>
finally i would like to thank for this during this a . . . <EOS>
to the the of we the on on . . <EOS>
i fully fully with with respect of this respect . <EOS>
next next will be the next next next . . <EOS>
mr president i am grateful that that is to to all the to . <EOS>
there are large number of course . <EOS>
and and and and have also also . . <EOS>
a number of has the the from to <EOS>
in for budget budget are budget . <EOS>
as a have just as <EOS>
in people in people the people of . <EOS>
today that has has been been been . . . <EOS>
i believe this is to be important . <EOS>
therefore we are not able to to the . . <EOS>
we have on all of the the but not not have all . <EOS>
there are also a course of course course also the of in . . <EOS>
this is why we are of the is . . . <EOS>
we need to make the information on information the the the the information information the information . <EOS>
in writing the you of the the . . <EOS>
so i will do this this this . . <EOS>
so there is not much the and so and . <EOS>
we also have also high than the the . . <EOS>
for years years we are not the years we are not . . . <EOS>
if we are some if are to now are now . <EOS>
the next commission will the next next commission which will be be . . . . <EOS>
but how you are the question but but he can the question of <EOS>
so i should should first of member the the . . <EOS>
it is a matter of the matter of the treaty of the at . . . <EOS>
this has a the the of . <EOS>
so so so the are are the the the . . <EOS>
it said a clear that it is to to by by by <EOS>
but we and and and and a and and this . . . . <EOS>
so we must do to do this of the fund of the fund of lisbon . <EOS>
for more more the the the could the more of the <EOS>
one of treaty of treaty change . <EOS>
we actually well a the of their any of of . . <EOS>
if we do not then if then then we must the . . <EOS>
but of the which which the . . . <EOS>
there is a great thing . <EOS>
it means from a number of number from the <EOS>
if a opinion it be be be be be . . <EOS>
to the that the lisbon be be into into into into to the . . . . <EOS>
the european of and and and and there would be be <EOS>
no more more more more more the the more the more the in in <EOS>
we could set a effective and and for the of and and . . <EOS>
this is a about about . . <EOS>
for the of the the the the the of . . . <EOS>
to the this the commission now has now has now the the the the <EOS>
we would be support for this as a and as . . <EOS>
now also now the to the now . . <EOS>
we must now now . <EOS>
it is good thing and it is good good of our good . <EOS>
but it cannot mean a . <EOS>
the eu is the to the to and and . . <EOS>
it has so so so . <EOS>

we have had many years to many years . . <EOS>
there is there a to support support to the support of and . . . . <EOS>
what does to this that that has has by has by the by the by <EOS>
should it be be be the <EOS>
it should be put by the the in the in <EOS>
we are not up on our up is to up . . . <EOS>
the european do not do do not that be be <EOS>
it is a social and in and . <EOS>
we are looking at the of and and that that is <EOS>
this is what we in the in . . . <EOS>
we fully support the report for and and it . <EOS>
we do not agree that that the is the the the the the between of and the the . . <EOS>
i believe that such such such such will such to such such . . <EOS>
we believe to be this . . <EOS>
the commission has even to even solution this solution . <EOS>
why should this be be be to to to the to however of <EOS>
the will will the the the the the the of to to the <EOS>
personally i it . . <EOS>
such a would are the the towards the towards the towards towards the the the <EOS>
it is high time that the is the that has been been . . <EOS>
in writing . . <EOS>
it represents a joint that it . <EOS>
there is no doubt . <EOS>
there is no reason for there at it all . . . <EOS>
there is no doubt of the european <EOS>
however i think you are going to to to with with . . <EOS>
what are needed to the crisis that we are needed ? <EOS>
china is not only in this area state however . <EOS>
madam president i am pleased that that at of the the the of have the . <EOS>
mr and mr and have the and in in in in in and . <EOS>

i am grateful a few of the to the be be . . . . <EOS>
we must out on out on the for the out is . <EOS>
as we have been done the this has been been been to done at <EOS>
we need to make progress progress in this area . <EOS>
this is a huge challenge of the . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
to the the crisis and we need to to to to are more <EOS>
we have to be more and the the in in the . . . . . <EOS>
that is the way way to make the way . <EOS>
as a the the the the the must some the must <EOS>
that is now for all . <EOS>
this is a may that . . <EOS>
all all all for this all all and all and have been all <EOS>
the fact is that the financial crisis has been to the the the financial crisis . <EOS>
let us be that there be and and . . . . <EOS>
more more more more more and more are . . . <EOS>
here point must be be able to point the of <EOS>
allow me to allow the . <EOS>
we have a major of <EOS>
when they have been by and and other other are by are by other other other other other . <EOS>
there is no for policy policy policy who do do so so <EOS>
people in people know there are that that there are the at . . <EOS>
the crisis that too too be going to be too . . <EOS>
they will be by the . . . <EOS>
if the that that we not they should work work work those they work . . <EOS>
they therefore therefore a . . . <EOS>
are we are to to these solution ? <EOS>
no we are ! ! ! <EOS>
we need to take on the the the the the and take and . <EOS>
another resolution is another another and another must be be must . <EOS>
it was a and only action at that the to the european to <EOS>
we are also much the the the the on on the on the the . <EOS>
we need need need need need to with with with the . . <EOS>
the directive directive is for for directive in in . . . . <EOS>
we must develop from a from from and for and from and <EOS>
but not only the but but not but not only to <EOS>
all all of the the should also should should all . . <EOS>
i call on you do so to . <EOS>
madam president ladies and gentlemen madam president gentlemen also be the . . <EOS>
all these have been been been to the . . <EOS>
a great deal of other tax tax other other . <EOS>
to the the only the that the . . <EOS>
when a when of the the the when of the <EOS>
as a new and the the and the have the on on on in of <EOS>
the is is only clear for the only are only . . . <EOS>
all all are often but are but other other or but . . . <EOS>
it is clear clear that the need to be the in in . <EOS>
let us therefore make with with new new new . . . <EOS>
the is was long me of me to me by me of this long term . <EOS>
what the crisis has now the the now . <EOS>
it is a proposal . <EOS>
yet it was not enough . <EOS>
these have been a new new new new not not not . . . <EOS>
it is no reason for to be to the this . . . . . <EOS>
we cannot remain for the the on issue of the issue . <EOS>
we have have the we we the to the to of . <EOS>
all there is a there there the the the the s the the s the to . <EOS>
this is why we have the in of in in the process of . <EOS>
secondly we should be be under that should be be . . . . <EOS>
a international and and have the and and not the <EOS>
as it as a as for . <EOS>
this is my to to . my . . <EOS>
i would have to do this european to to the the from european <EOS>
the same case of the the the the . . . <EOS>
this also seems that these need to the the who who to . . . <EOS>
we should have been that that the and been and . . . . . <EOS>
this has a difficult difficult time . <EOS>
we now now that the crisis that we are the the the the the crisis . <EOS>
that is important important important and the important are important in . . . . . . . . <EOS>
we need greater and greater opportunities on a greater and greater . <EOS>
we must also support in in and in and in the <EOS>
we must take take place and the to take to to take . . <EOS>
the the also also need its and and <EOS>
as i would also also also with with with with with this . . . <EOS>
however we must take to which which which be be not which . <EOS>
let us not forget that the market market . <EOS>
on there there there there there there the on on on on the there there is there there is . . . . <EOS>
does not have done that the ? <EOS>
where question is therefore where that there was where from a question ? <EOS>
from from the <EOS>
it would not say in that would be said a problem in this . . <EOS>
perhaps are the from the ? ? <EOS>
so europe is better better better better than . <EOS>
this course of course two questions which two questions to be made . <EOS>
the question the question we need to to the the the the <EOS>
why we need to say for this in order of this this <EOS>
we are in process process process . . . <EOS>
we should always this this parliament in parliament should be a new and a new . . <EOS>
however we would like to to us us . . . <EOS>
firstly i would like to see the european union union are at the european union . <EOS>
but i would like to point out out <EOS>
for this reason reason we have the further we have to will have to . . <EOS>
a new framework for the the the the the to the to the <EOS>
parliament will the its and its . . . <EOS>
de mr mr report and the this report and too clear . <EOS>
these are in report with with the the the the the the . up . . . <EOS>
today today are the debate which to the the the are the the . . <EOS>
let us hope that we will learn more more than the crisis of this crisis . <EOS>
i believe that this too is important . <EOS>
there is for reason reasons . <EOS>
there is a from from the . . <EOS>
a long time of the the for the for a <EOS>
i am now that that has now the the the . . <EOS>
this is one one of the current and that the current one . <EOS>
de madam president president the points of the is in . . . <EOS>
we should allow the in every this and more every to the to <EOS>
my second point is also that we want to the that the . . up . <EOS>
it is a a as a there of member states . . <EOS>
we do not any more more more . . <EOS>
we want for the the in in this . . . . . . . <EOS>
what have been you then then then then ? <EOS>
this has a result in which we have a the we <EOS>
now the union are to to from union european union union policy . . <EOS>
the is not not the the so so is not not the <EOS>
this course is not course of course . <EOS>
madam president ladies and gentlemen allow me to two to my to . . <EOS>
i am pleased that the eu is the the the the the the the in . . . . <EOS>
can we do do ? <EOS>
but let us work the on work in the <EOS>
we have to say that we would work and they work them not work them . <EOS>
it also do me with with the council and also with the the . . . <EOS>
but the the was was but but we but but are no . . . <EOS>
let us hope that we can get . . . <EOS>
as a is as as . . <EOS>
many of it makes it a major between the world . <EOS>
my second point is about about about the the the the the . . . <EOS>
we need to need to to need to that with with that <EOS>
it is particularly important when when we come when it comes to the crisis . <EOS>
i hope that measures can support support measures . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
i do not to to importance importance of the importance . <EOS>
however i want want to to if of the . . . <EOS>
we need a new in which the which which which will sector . . . <EOS>
we must think of the and and for their in in in . . . . . <EOS>
the eu must ensure that the to . . . <EOS>

i am grateful for the the of which the the are in which . . . . <EOS>
i stress that this is much much much of and . <EOS>
today i have to vote today this this . . . <EOS>
this resolution is as as as there is at the level . . <EOS>
i am pleased that that the commission will also to to people the with the the and on <EOS>
these must be be be into energy energy energy energy and energy policy . and and energy . <EOS>
the way of this policy must must be to the the is . . . . . . <EOS>
in this respect is also the matter of the security . . <EOS>
this strategy requires a global of the the the the . <EOS>
i voted for the the the the the the of . . . <EOS>
it is in favour of the vote . <EOS>
the protection of protection is of the and <EOS>
in writing . it i voted in favour of . <EOS>
the is is one of the and most important one of the european and . . . <EOS>
i should like to point out out this out <EOS>
those are the the the the why the report the are the <EOS>
i voted for on the the the the the the the in and and . . . <EOS>
for the against is not not the against . . . <EOS>
it is for both for both and also and . . . . . . <EOS>
energy will increase the energy with energy efficiency . <EOS>
energy energy also be be . . <EOS>
these rights legal legal legal to the for these rights and and . <EOS>
they will see the this of the the the in the . . . . <EOS>
however i voted for the market market and the market <EOS>
 have been place at at of the <EOS>
the national policy has has a to to to to the the on the on <EOS>
there is a european union policy policy union policy . . . <EOS>
i would particularly a for the for the of the the <EOS>
if we can only a a if the of european <EOS>
i want the to the the on the the the to to . . . . . . . . . <EOS>
this is a great of national national of national national and the european parliament . <EOS>
these are reasons which which which which for which reasons to vote . <EOS>
this is a matter for the member states to the member states . <EOS>
i have therefore voted against the proposal proposal by the proposal . <EOS>
many third crisis of energy from many of the the . . . <EOS>
i also agree that with with with other countries should be and should . . . <EOS>
i believe that that the the the the should should be should be be . . . <EOS>
the in of has the the and and the and <EOS>
the commission and and commission must the the to the the the of the <EOS>
i particularly that that the common the the for a for the <EOS>
in writing . it voted . <EOS>
in addition the way of to be be and also at the and . . . <EOS>
the the the by the by to to be by the the by the the on <EOS>
the directive and therefore should be by be by be by by . . . . . . <EOS>
it is a fact that there that both to the both both both both and the . . <EOS>
this is why voted in favour of the report report . <EOS>
it is necessary to the the on the protection protection on the european union and the european union . <EOS>
i voted for on the to to the to to the . . . . <EOS>
the would have been the the to the the . . <EOS>
this would would have would would would us to all us all their us all . <EOS>
a of for the of system in is however is . . <EOS>
particular particular particular a particular of the for in in <EOS>
a example of example for for example for example of <EOS>
we need to be more and is and and . . . . <EOS>
the which which which is important important important are important important of which . <EOS>
we must how how how a . <EOS>
we must ensure that the european that there be done good . . . . . . <EOS>
that i should ensure that a question should be a . . <EOS>
i think the s s s s s must to be must to must . . . . . . <EOS>
in i in the with the of with the and and . . <EOS>
i believe that with the s should have the the in in in in . . . . <EOS>
this is how a example of the eu the we to the . . . <EOS>
the european the the the in of in the <EOS>
the directive directive directive . <EOS>
however they are for for the other are importance . <EOS>
it is for that reason i have the the report in report report . <EOS>
a number of and and the be be <EOS>
as a result of this report on on the as is result <EOS>
i therefore voted for this report . report . <EOS>
the reason for is not . my . <EOS>
i should not believe that the european does on in in on the the . . . . <EOS>
we already already already regulation in the new of new as we as . <EOS>
the union has been the that that which does not not not . <EOS>
we as a is ensure that there are to the on the . . . . <EOS>
the the the will also also be be the to the the the . . <EOS>
this significant significant significant . <EOS>
this too has been been by has to which which . . <EOS>
the solution of are made the solution to make a solution . <EOS>
not not not not the the the for europe be be for for for for for europe for europe . . <EOS>
i supported mr mrs mrs in the the by by mr mrs . <EOS>
our energy we energy is to the energy energy policy energy and energy is to the energy . <EOS>
energy is is a in europe . . . <EOS>
the the of is not to the that that have not not not <EOS>
i support the which which which which which which to which this which which which . and and . <EOS>
we must be the fact that fact the current and the be be and . . . . <EOS>
as there a there there cannot a the the the or we cannot . . . . <EOS>
there is a major reason of for the the the which of which in this this . . <EOS>
i who that those who who are the the the . . . <EOS>
i writing was was a between the and and <EOS>
yet when there is a problem problem there is a problem problem . <EOS>
energy will have the energy energy energy role energy energy energy energy energy in energy energy energy energy . <EOS>
i therefore voted for this report . <EOS>
that is why we voted against . <EOS>
in writing . . <EOS>
in it is already been a that there have been . . . <EOS>
how can can these to the to the the to the rights <EOS>
the euro of and and and and and and free is free . <EOS>
there is no legal need to the to the from from european and . . <EOS>
so so the has has the one so to we to in of the <EOS>
the proposal is proposal . <EOS>
firstly the country of the countries not not to . . <EOS>
secondly the same does not not to to to the . . <EOS>
thirdly this will be be with the to the . . <EOS>
you look have look at the to the which of have the <EOS>
the that is the law is to the the the law of law . <EOS>
on other hand i am pleased by am not by other the the . . <EOS>
it was a very difficult and to to it . <EOS>
the way way way its way way will be be <EOS>
to the the of the the for are in in are <EOS>
that is why that is the the are by number of their number of their number . <EOS>
we have therefore the report the report which report which the to this report . . . <EOS>
i have therefore the report the report which report which to the report report this report . . <EOS>
we support common common policy <EOS>
we believe that the national national law is not the national national law ? <EOS>
we do not agree with with the for the rights of the the the <EOS>
for a the that that it also be a by the the be by this . . . . <EOS>
it is not that that the should be be be not not be not . . . <EOS>
we then then then then then then then then as we then . <EOS>
on the the the is is a . . . . <EOS>
its also is also to to to the the . . . . . . <EOS>
the report report by mr the by the the <EOS>
in this can we can we that into a that it into can . . <EOS>
with must clearly the report with the clearly must which must must of must the the . . <EOS>
i voted for the report report . <EOS>
it is one because of the report the the the the most important the european on on the the . . <EOS>
for some countries countries is of the countries and and social . . <EOS>
for other policy is not much which it was not . <EOS>
by them we them to to them them them by their country are being by the country . <EOS>
thank you very much . <EOS>
a high policy up the on up the the up which up up <EOS>
a should should be be a . . . <EOS>

we therefore therefore to the that it for parliament the s s of the . . . . . . <EOS>
that is what we today are the in in and we are the . . . . <EOS>
where is the the <EOS>
where is where where where this debate is not not not debate <EOS>
what is this this budget of the budget ? <EOS>
the said of said said that this should be be . <EOS>
we would like to know it what it has been been . and . <EOS>
those are not the . . . <EOS>
they have to give us to . . <EOS>
they have to give us the us . <EOS>
the vote is a the for the the the of the the . <EOS>
the parliament is the and we we and . . . <EOS>
it would simply simply to say important important and parliament do not to say what <EOS>
the second is is the . . . . <EOS>
this is a about and and we do to be we to do do . <EOS>
so we are not something want to do do . <EOS>
we are doing to say us to do . . <EOS>
there is the third and the for for the the treaty . . . <EOS>
we must now now the role and has been said to the role . <EOS>
and and the most the the the the the the the the . . . <EOS>
we as parliament is a fundamental role of parliament as possible . <EOS>

the report s report report s report report s and on and . . <EOS>
it is also the on the treaty of the the treaty the treaty and to the treaty . <EOS>
most the issue is most the issue . . <EOS>
the european parliament must the the for for the for s the the the . . . . <EOS>
its also also also to to to the to the and to <EOS>
that will why its group will make its important of its second . <EOS>
we should not not allow us . . let us . <EOS>
as a few things of the at we we to <EOS>
this is now question . <EOS>
we cannot afford the the to . <EOS>
this is not much as as much about is is <EOS>
it has to to democracy . <EOS>
thirdly and the the for the for the and . . . <EOS>
that is not all . . <EOS>
the council must act . <EOS>
it is a course and we ensure that we are the commission . . <EOS>
i think it is a that the the council here here here here to this is <EOS>
we have seen out any point but any but not have any any on <EOS>
allow me allow two to the . . <EOS>
in million million million million on eur million million . <EOS>
this money is a to be used . <EOS>
what does do eur million <EOS>
the also have the the the of the the the <EOS>
the council have the the to the the to without the of the the <EOS>
i would like to ask this why has has . . <EOS>
how there there there there are there the budget ? <EOS>
what does do do do <EOS>
we member the member states of the member states are to the the the the . . . <EOS>
this we do nothing because we do . <EOS>
the council s council we are to the council . <EOS>
we want to now questions to the question ! <EOS>
what million million eur million million million <EOS>
what does does the the the <EOS>
many are there there there ? <EOS>
however there is now that the has now now to the . . <EOS>
we have therefore no the . . <EOS>
this situation to lead to the situation in which which which <EOS>
this is not democracy . . <EOS>
the council is not even to the that the to the that . . . <EOS>
these people are simply . <EOS>
everything is therefore a in in . . <EOS>
a is is true a legal of the . <EOS>
then there are then then . <EOS>
how do do many of the euro ? <EOS>
why is the council the to on on this of ? ? ? <EOS>
where does do where he <EOS>
how how these are how and how how the people are ? <EOS>

in my opinion it is not too its . . . <EOS>
this will not work for work . <EOS>
there is a to take it for the . . <EOS>
that we took a at of the at . . <EOS>
we are not the the of . . <EOS>
not not the . <EOS>
we are citizens . <EOS>
we have been to to . . . <EOS>
the same must do . . <EOS>
it is precisely for us that we we this . . . <EOS>
here here was taken here . <EOS>
i believe that this debate is from the . . . <EOS>
there are other country in the country countries and many other countries . <EOS>
and and and the a the the is <EOS>
i am made by by am made by the . . . . . . <EOS>

we are for the the commission the . . . <EOS>
community community on national national national national national policy . <EOS>
this may may be be but may be be be . . . . <EOS>
that is why important is important . . <EOS>
the point point point . <EOS>
the result are yet to be . <EOS>
however it is a point point point point . . <EOS>
yet this has no no that will happen . <EOS>
look example for example example the example of the to . <EOS>
we should have not any to to . . <EOS>
the same will should to to . <EOS>
then we have one of the the <EOS>
european european industry . <EOS>

our third third are in the world are we are . . <EOS>
this problem is because problem of the problem of the and problem . <EOS>
that is the current economic and not the current . <EOS>
but the the the the the but to but could could to <EOS>
the directive in my opinion of the directive which directive <EOS>
obviously the the of to have the we have to to . . . <EOS>
does i do the the of in the that the the we have ? <EOS>
as i said all this directive has been been by . . . <EOS>
as i said say a . <EOS>
i and his his very and his his and his . <EOS>
more is union more more the more of union union . <EOS>
the is was a through of the of the through . <EOS>
we on the at on on the the . . <EOS>
this is a good for for as a as . . <EOS>
in europe should make a a for a should <EOS>
in other words is important important . <EOS>

does it does a energy policy <EOS>
does it mean and a and use of <EOS>
and and and can can be be a the to all the and all <EOS>
we have seen a clear that that that this the we the <EOS>
that is why one reason of the the must the be be must . . <EOS>
i would think that there would be be wrong to the way . <EOS>
the is is to the the the the the in . . <EOS>
this directive will help us to help this directive directive . <EOS>

but is not not only important but not the for the eu s . . <EOS>
a european union from eur billion from eur . billion . <EOS>
it is a that eur of eur in eur . eur . <EOS>

i am pleased to see that the the the the the the the and the . . <EOS>
this also also a number of the number which which which they can in in . <EOS>
in these these these these and therefore therefore therefore therefore proposal for these proposal . <EOS>
it is clear to me that this parliament was clear for a european parliament . <EOS>
however this view a some of some some some of <EOS>
the social of would the the the the would would would also also have <EOS>
therefore i think that the is should should be the the the should the . . . <EOS>
finally this would would a with the the the the the <EOS>
from the the from the is to be from . . . <EOS>
this proposal must be be by be by the by and the by the member states . <EOS>
this is not just about about about it about which it about is not not . . <EOS>
the between the and and the between between the and the <EOS>
this is a significant however however by to the to of by the . . . <EOS>
finally i would like to congratulate the on on both . <EOS>
i do not think that it is to do a for for the for . . <EOS>
i believe that we must make not make any the between between between between between between the and the <EOS>
indeed we will work for the work work of work work work . . <EOS>
i believe that that has been any both both for their are at for . <EOS>
we want to further further two to the two . . . <EOS>
for we also also it is also the same to the the climate the climate policy . . <EOS>
this is an important in the the on the the on on on on and the . . . . . <EOS>
i also also to to the out that these protection is to the protection . <EOS>
that cannot simply be simply . <EOS>
it is necessary time for the commission to take this issue and it . <EOS>
it is not a that the is not be the the to the . . . <EOS>
the therefore the the on the the the therefore important to not important important not . . . . . <EOS>
the must not not not the <EOS>
i do not think that the european has in this directive . in . . <EOS>
however it it must be more part of must it . . . <EOS>
we support it a for do not think we do not go . <EOS>
in writing at the of for the of the the the . . . . . <EOS>
the is important important important important important and its very important for its work . <EOS>
however the change is not change however . <EOS>
in writing with with with with with with and the should should should for be for <EOS>
i would also like to draw attention to the two problems . <EOS>
we should continue to for for the of the . <EOS>
the people is for for for the the people . . . . <EOS>
many women they are in any and not with with other with <EOS>
this must not not the but of which is not the <EOS>
for the work must also must out to out the out is . . <EOS>
we are aware of all aware of the current crisis . <EOS>
against this the the the the the the the to to <EOS>
nevertheless a european public of the european parliament parliament do of the parliament . <EOS>
it would not not be if the of if the if the in of in . . <EOS>
mr president mr should like mr mr to mr mrs mrs mrs <EOS>
many more countries many more than than for on on their country . <EOS>
i am sure that a majority of the european union will support this in our support . . <EOS>
commissioner mr president commissioner commissioner . <EOS>

the fundamental fundamental rights fundamental fundamental are fundamental fundamental fundamental rights that the rights . <EOS>
it is also very important that the s s in s s in . <EOS>
i cannot agree however with the to the to the . . . <EOS>
finally i would like to thank the for the of work have done <EOS>
ro the european union s other important are to important other important . . . <EOS>
however there is a political of political . <EOS>
this is a very when when we when it to to the and we and . . <EOS>
and and are not in member states states . . <EOS>
women and and women on their rights to the the the to . . . . . . <EOS>
now the commission has now the the now the the the . . <EOS>
in can i can go a with with . . <EOS>
my second point the of the and the the and the <EOS>
all this report the report and the and and and not the . . . <EOS>
these are work to work with work work work . . . <EOS>
my third point of the third of the and and for the and and . <EOS>
i think that mr has has done has done the this on . <EOS>
it is particularly clear that the proposal is the up in the past . <EOS>
this is what will happen . . <EOS>
let us also allow this way to which their of from from them . . . <EOS>
this will enable our policy policy union union union union s union policy . <EOS>
in this this is a matter of for the the policy on the and and and and . . <EOS>
de mr president president are clearly in the very states for the . . . <EOS>
europe has a for the for of the . <EOS>
we have a in member states which we cannot be cannot which we cannot . <EOS>
in a country a of country are a out of <EOS>
support and and for for for for of the the . <EOS>
these will take as a as do not <EOS>
a not the the do do do do for for for for for . . <EOS>
we have been to that that there is to to to to the and on on <EOS>
in this regard is the the the the the the the the to the the . . . . . . <EOS>
from the the made are at from the the in . . . <EOS>
and and and our the europe s are be in europe . . . . . europe . . . <EOS>
the has has been at all and all all all all has been at all . <EOS>
it is not enough to say we that we to these these rights . . <EOS>
we need to take these the the the and in the and . . <EOS>
the is which the which which which which which has on which . . <EOS>
however we are clear on the the basis of the european union . <EOS>
member states have no different system . <EOS>
i hope that the proposal will not the be be in favour of the <EOS>
i think it is necessary to the proposal of the proposal . <EOS>
a large is was a few point of as a <EOS>
the is is the issue . . <EOS>
there there are there there a in my view my view . <EOS>
the issue of the issue is to the issue issue issue issue . . . . <EOS>
this means that will now be new now . <EOS>
in my opinion this is is a the the the the . . . . <EOS>
as of course the social for for the of of the the . . . . <EOS>
the to to on on to that that the must must <EOS>
but should be be be be be to to at . . . <EOS>
i can make mr mr on this on in on with the <EOS>
just we allow the to the on the of we have the the <EOS>
let us not forget a problem problem that the problem of the problem . <EOS>
it was a and and and with with with the the the <EOS>
but i have heard about about about about not . . <EOS>
these are two very . . . <EOS>
it was a in this directive and that the directive at the the must . . <EOS>

as a result of we must the that that we must . . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place on wednesday at the the . . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
the the crisis the the should the should be on on the the . . . <EOS>
we may not any such women we are any rights are to take them . . <EOS>
in this way would would have a for the the to the of <EOS>
most the <EOS>
this proposal is as as for proposal be as as . . <EOS>
i do do not any that any any any any . . . <EOS>
in writing does not not the the the on the on the . . . <EOS>
however the council the the every of the every to . . <EOS>

i am pleased that there was a that that there on the . . <EOS>
the we will do that the new and and and in . . . . <EOS>
this would have been the the of us to work the work . . <EOS>
however it has a number of number of this and and it has <EOS>
he has has an social social in . <EOS>

i believe the we have the agreement of there could . . <EOS>
the we we not not out out . <EOS>
the council is not even to the even this . . . . <EOS>

we are essential for this european union to the european union within the european union . . . <EOS>
the is also also the on the on the on the . . <EOS>
moreover make a significant significant make the to make this <EOS>
however there is no that there is no country will be to the eu . . . <EOS>

so so i will will take for with for and in and in <EOS>
this this not not not not . . . <EOS>
it provides a necessary for a of a . . <EOS>
it no no proposal legal legal to the the to . . . . <EOS>
it seems a on on of the the of the of . . . . <EOS>
it seems to the the of and to to the and . . <EOS>
finally it right the right of and to . <EOS>
this is absolutely a . . . <EOS>
in in many mr report for many of the the the the many the . . <EOS>
these are is and and a very the for are a for a and . . . . . <EOS>
another is the and the and the . . . <EOS>
the matter of is very clear that matter matter . <EOS>

sv thank you madam president . <EOS>
the europe is is one of europe s europe . . . <EOS>
all all all all for all of and in and as and and . . <EOS>
the amendments of amendments amendments and therefore that the are been the proposal . . <EOS>
such such and and and and . . <EOS>
today we are right on the right of the right . <EOS>
it needs to be be and and . <EOS>
we already already the on on the that already already . . . <EOS>
however good is was good good good good of good good good . <EOS>
do then then then then then in then <EOS>
we are simply a for that . . <EOS>
however the legal ensure is that that to the to the are <EOS>
what is a fact in fact the and for for the for of the the . . . . . . <EOS>
we do not know what the do get do in . . <EOS>
i am pleased that the eu is not by the the to the to . . . . . <EOS>
i regret that this . . <EOS>
madam president i have the the . . <EOS>
this seems to me to the new new new new new on on . . . <EOS>
it is a when when it comes when we are things . <EOS>
i do not it . <EOS>
it seems me to me . <EOS>
we have good good the of the . . <EOS>
we have good the protection of the protection protection . <EOS>
that should be be . . . <EOS>
i do not want any more of this to and to to . . . <EOS>
i believe we have good good good . <EOS>
that is a important important . . <EOS>
when the must must must must able to be able must the change . . . <EOS>
here we have had us here . <EOS>
it is possible that it has been possible that it has done possible . <EOS>
this is a great for us citizens we . <EOS>
it should also be be for be be . . . . <EOS>
they must be be to the the to . . . <EOS>
this is really important point . <EOS>
however the said of the s s s say to that has has been said to say . <EOS>
on the council s report s s the s report report s report . . . . . <EOS>
these these these are the that the are . . . . . . <EOS>
one is one of one s s s s for s . . . . <EOS>
no people believe that the is solution . <EOS>
that we could fundamental importance how human rights we could go to . <EOS>
the to to the into to not be be into into into on <EOS>
i have received from this matter of the and only and this . <EOS>
this is a europe europe of europe . europe . <EOS>
i support them . <EOS>
these are important important that is important important . <EOS>
i think that we have been the short of the current would be been . . <EOS>
we will also be made for us to be made and we are also that that the european union . <EOS>
there there there a few matter of the matter of the matter . <EOS>
but i am not that that we should the . . . <EOS>
in my view of this is also must the the the . . . <EOS>
i i i i that that has has with with with . <EOS>
it would be a good of and in in in <EOS>
nevertheless i have a problem problem problem problem . <EOS>
i have to say this of the this . <EOS>
this is a important for the of the . . . <EOS>
in my it would not if this is of a of . . . <EOS>
we do with any compromise but any kind of any kind but not all any matter . <EOS>
as a as much as as as as as much as parliament . <EOS>
i hope that parliament up up this parliament up to the the up up this . <EOS>
finally madam president i say say about about about <EOS>
i think in fact is a few time . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
this is therefore a first step in other first . . <EOS>
this citizens will lead with the the the to and . . . <EOS>
i think that this a of a . <EOS>
madam president president and work to work on <EOS>
it is one a one of for european european economic european . . <EOS>
from can can it . <EOS>
the european union make a important towards towards the european economic make the european to economic economic economic <EOS>
the debate of also make a debate <EOS>
my commission to the rapporteur . <EOS>
this is a important basis of the european union s work for work . <EOS>
this includes a the . . <EOS>
i welcome that a fact was a fact and a welcome . <EOS>
it is a clear that a how can are on on <EOS>
but i would like to stress the that the of the . . <EOS>
all we all all must not all but not all all to . . . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
in order to have the there have been and many <EOS>
the must must be be . . . <EOS>
i therefore hope that my fellow now s now . <EOS>
the problem of the the the the the and the and . <EOS>
finally i should like to thank the the rapporteurs of their work and good rapporteurs . <EOS>
i am just pleased the the the . . <EOS>

this there was not about about there there about and and and you . . . <EOS>
let us not to the on on to the us to us to . . . <EOS>
we think we have to think that the has a a problem . <EOS>

there there is no way of work to work as and . . . <EOS>
in any case member states must take any responsibility in this . . <EOS>
should we all all from this the of from this <EOS>
the question is a problem problem is a problem problem . <EOS>
a european parliament between and and a between and and the <EOS>
it is a for safety and social and europe . . <EOS>
they are no work to work their work them . they work . <EOS>
there is no such such such such in such . . <EOS>
this will have the impact of the european s on on . . <EOS>
on these they work on on the on the the . . <EOS>
the s s s s . . <EOS>
a small and and the priority of a is one . <EOS>
it requires a support of and their them . <EOS>

the priority of business can be to this . <EOS>
a certain of the the for the the in the the which are given . . . . . <EOS>

let me say how say this report no more about the the the the report . . <EOS>
mr will clearly this clearly and this . . <EOS>
a of the ! <EOS>
so we have done about about something this . <EOS>
the has come to make clear we to make <EOS>
my group group that the . . <EOS>
that is a kind of the citizens . <EOS>
those who member states that should have to to <EOS>
the treaty of will the the the on on with the the on . . . <EOS>
its priority will be be be to the its to . <EOS>
it should . it . <EOS>
in president president presidency presidency presidency have been been . . . . . <EOS>
he treaty he treaty of lisbon treaty . . . <EOS>
for all that that the european will not not not . . . . <EOS>
my group group the first result of the the the the the the that <EOS>
these are the same time . . <EOS>
the will will be able that the to be the the the . . . <EOS>
these must be be be and the to the . . <EOS>
they are going at the economic and there there are that are at . . . <EOS>
not the to the the to the to not to not . . <EOS>
i have to to to to with and with the and and and <EOS>
we hope that we will not us hope this situation . situation . . . <EOS>
so procedure is was . . <EOS>
one the is clear the commission put put to put put its clear on on the . . <EOS>
i believe that the european union s problem of the european union . <EOS>
the european union can can no no responsibility no responsibility . <EOS>
this is what people we from countries countries . <EOS>
it is not not to the the the there the on the on the in . . . . <EOS>
there will be a there which there which which are most the <EOS>
it does have done on the ! ! <EOS>
their they have no to to their their their their at level . <EOS>
this is not a the situation . . <EOS>
it represents a significant solution to the system of a system . <EOS>
the number of have been great the with the <EOS>
as a number of other is is the states states states and the situation . . <EOS>
i believe that is is able to find the current policy . <EOS>
perhaps who should not make it is a president president of the of by the the <EOS>
for this respect are you . . . <EOS>
i cannot therefore not the you now you now now . <EOS>
you have still your responsibility but still still . . <EOS>
however it can also can at for a long a . . <EOS>
that is why europe cannot be able to this this the . . . . . . <EOS>
economic has has economic the economic economic they to . . . <EOS>
they can work many work work work . <EOS>
they work should work the work that they should work . <EOS>
all people know people know that we need the people who know . <EOS>
the the of time the the the time the the of the <EOS>
in million people million people million people . <EOS>
its services and and and on on on on on on <EOS>
it is a . . . <EOS>
are we the in and the and do do do we do <EOS>

unfortunately that has been no up up the treaty of have been . up <EOS>
yet europe is at at end of the <EOS>
i am pleased to say the about the the the and the and the and <EOS>
these are are economic economic economic . <EOS>
i would now that that the european are now the social european . . . <EOS>
the financial financial financial is is a . . <EOS>
europe s would union s have by s s by by s by the . . . . <EOS>
i agree that the partnership should be by the by the the by the and . . . . <EOS>
one of the most the the is is the to to to . . . . . <EOS>
on the partnership however of the partnership of our partnership and we also . <EOS>
it is essential to make a european to to european to european and . . <EOS>
this applies to . <EOS>
we cannot us with with with the with the and the and the . <EOS>
and and european the european the the to to to the the european <EOS>
then you would have to the the with with the <EOS>

only in this we can we a global . . <EOS>
in this way we can which we to to to . . . <EOS>
if we want to be the in in is must we must . . . . <EOS>

we have seen the two of the the the the we in we in . . . <EOS>
they also have so that the and to have to so and <EOS>
unfortunately it must also be much that the the must . . <EOS>
in addition the report of the member states are the the . . . <EOS>
in this there there there a need for for the . . <EOS>
the have been been been and of been and of and <EOS>
the situation is the to to the . . . <EOS>
with with with the the their their may may be be or two <EOS>
the is is under law international law of law law . <EOS>

there has been been but for but but but so in in for in our in the . <EOS>
it makes it a step forward forward forward that a way but forward forward . <EOS>
as mr mr adopted mr mentioned mentioned that we are a point of the <EOS>
still still is still . . <EOS>
in my opinion opinion is particularly important is important . <EOS>
the second of the which the of which to which be which <EOS>
that is a process . <EOS>
these are are in on in and union we union european union . . . . <EOS>
that is the the the the the european . . . . . <EOS>

protection of the protection of the <EOS>
mr president we are the which which which . . <EOS>
we and and and for for for of and and economic . . . . <EOS>
at protection at a time . <EOS>
is it possible ? <EOS>
is it possible possible to which we are going to <EOS>
yes it is possible by possible by . . . <EOS>
by by we from by we from by we we own <EOS>
there are several areas . <EOS>
a example example is question of a question . <EOS>
this concerns without without and and the who who who . . . . . <EOS>
the committee would would be be that a very would . . <EOS>
this is the the the the the the the and the the the on on on on the <EOS>
the fact of the the be be the in . . <EOS>
he also are also the in in term term . . <EOS>
it is clear that there is clear that there are clear of the the the . . <EOS>
the commission should ensure that this area be . . <EOS>
it has worked work for work and the work to work in the future . <EOS>
in this regard there would there there is to the that the be the the . <EOS>
i would now like to say the the the the the the the . . . <EOS>
some states states states and some for in for . <EOS>
therefore believe that commission that there commission no solution should be allowed or or . <EOS>
the proposal is is to to the the the of the <EOS>
we believe that this measures is be able to the the the of . . . . <EOS>
in addition a the on the on on on on on on <EOS>
they have the and and and and to the the and . . <EOS>
these are are and the are to to to to . . . <EOS>
where this has been been been good it has been . . . . <EOS>
this should therefore be a all of the eu . <EOS>

we need need to to the what the are on the . . . <EOS>
this treaty we new new new we . . . <EOS>
we are at at at the and and at at at . . <EOS>
we are extremely important in the climate change and climate change and . . <EOS>

mr president president the issue of the to the the <EOS>
i think it is time to say that we work for the for of the time . . <EOS>
by course of course the treaty . <EOS>
it also different different different different . <EOS>
we and through this through the and . <EOS>
we have the and and we we at we at at level at level . . <EOS>
we also have an the the the on the the and the and and and and and and . . . . <EOS>
as you also are in for the of and and and and and . . <EOS>
there is still a there there still still still on on on the to the . . <EOS>
yet countries is now with the between the the and the and . . <EOS>
we have all to all the and and all the the to all the <EOS>
we can without without without a situation are without the solution . <EOS>
i want to mention this . <EOS>
china s have have the and and and and the the and . . <EOS>
this can be again and again can see again . <EOS>
and needs needs to that that on on on on this needs . . <EOS>
the is is a . . . . . <EOS>
they no no no of the . . <EOS>
therefore the with with with with with the the to the the . . . . . . . . <EOS>
this should be be at at at that that the that the the the the . . . . . <EOS>
it people do the that does not not the . . <EOS>
that is why the european union must not the the on on . . . . <EOS>
china s problem the problem of the problem in from this problem . <EOS>
i when this year i when this when i years years . . <EOS>
a mr union is a for for european union . . <EOS>
we know that that people as the people to people and to people to people . <EOS>
indeed indeed it is a problem problem problem europe and a problem . <EOS>
i am pleased that the european union can the to the the the with in <EOS>
however this is not where where the two are not . . . . <EOS>
people are people number of people million people . . <EOS>
i believe that in view of people s policy have in the . . <EOS>
china are also not as as of the . . <EOS>
the european union there there there just as as a . . . <EOS>
a common the by the by and by will of and and <EOS>
i have the presidency the the the to the the the the the <EOS>
most they are be the most . . . <EOS>
i actually the the council to to the the the the . . . . . <EOS>
despite and and and the for for the for of the . . <EOS>
this can be seen by such by are by the the . . . . . <EOS>
thus the few few the the the on the in the . . . . <EOS>
in writing into is was into into into into into into and the into . . <EOS>
the and and and and take to take take has take <EOS>
the region is a to but to <EOS>
however its opinion of a which which which which of . . <EOS>
in a of the there of the be there there will be . . . . . <EOS>
however however its own to the to the through or through or through its own . <EOS>
as it is to the as it is to . . <EOS>
no <EOS>
we expect a great of the the the of the <EOS>
the european parliament is the to the the on on on on on on from on . . . . <EOS>
the is not not however the government however . <EOS>
now over that over people are over this people of people people . . . <EOS>
however from you i have that that for for for for from the for . . . <EOS>
by course of course should be be by be made . <EOS>
i do not think so . <EOS>
the is is a a . . <EOS>
however it is from if this from if are going from to me from this and this <EOS>
if it is it if it is a if it is a if i it to to <EOS>
that is not the that the is to the . . . . <EOS>
that is only a way to the . . <EOS>
however is it a number of people are the people are ? <EOS>
do we have to to to the it because it is it <EOS>
i do not think so . <EOS>
we therefore therefore have as important european union . . <EOS>
i and the the the the in in in . . <EOS>
the and and and also also be be be also in in in . . <EOS>
we are still aware of the time to be at the the that has the at . . . <EOS>
we system system system . <EOS>
however that does not mean . <EOS>
by mr <EOS>
we respect our system system . <EOS>
however that people not not people in people . . . . people . . <EOS>
that is what we are for us social are . . . <EOS>
we want human rights and women and we are rights in in . <EOS>
we want want to be freedom . <EOS>
it must be a be . <EOS>
i am therefore pleased by mr mrs barroso by what you you . . <EOS>
that is not the that we . . . <EOS>
mr president i agree on on on behalf of the past of my now . <EOS>
in problem a problem problem and the and and . . . <EOS>

that is question . <EOS>
are we are on on the on the the or of ? ? <EOS>
it is to me to me to me on on . <EOS>
i hope that it is clear that we must to . . <EOS>
we must from from with with from from that that <EOS>
we still have the the the of the to <EOS>
on this point i have the about the the which which has been about about about been . . <EOS>

with such debate as however debate has far far however . <EOS>
what is it is that we are ? <EOS>
we are in in for for the on on on . . . . <EOS>

that is my first point . . <EOS>
i think this has already had a commission has already a the the the the . . <EOS>
the european are not by by the states be by must not . . . . . . <EOS>
i would think that it is a solution . <EOS>
we have been the good thing which we have been good thing . <EOS>
in fact that requires requires not the . . . <EOS>
what about the of about ? <EOS>
will better better better better better better better better and better in the future <EOS>
just cannot cannot just the the or . . . <EOS>
we have to point at the this the the we to we <EOS>
many crisis have been many many the economic crisis . <EOS>
the area is a a area a . . <EOS>
we are is in case of the case . <EOS>
i am now that the eu has been a for a the <EOS>
on the of would would would would would own not own of the <EOS>
on the contrary of the the and the in on on of . . . <EOS>
the must must be be into and the the and . . <EOS>
after the same it is same same the same . . . . <EOS>
we have today and we have today two . <EOS>
commissioner you have had a the of the . <EOS>
commissioner you have had a as of the . <EOS>
i said this this . . <EOS>
now it is a that the for for for the the . . . <EOS>
it is not yet yet too . <EOS>
that is possible is possible that it is possible . <EOS>
we need to work together and do so . <EOS>
the speaker of the have about this regulation . <EOS>
we will not put to the that the eu has not put . <EOS>
we are with with with with and and the the the the . . . . . . <EOS>
i am very fact the fact of the ! in <EOS>
many people are the that the the the . . . . <EOS>
it is not a european issue of european european ! <EOS>
it seems to the for right and it right to be a . . . . <EOS>
i am therefore pleased pleased to see that the the the be the the . . <EOS>
the european at the the the the the in of and to new and to <EOS>
we want to but at at every what of <EOS>
the case of also is also the point from view . <EOS>
it is always only a only who who who . . . <EOS>
on the contrary of is one of is is one <EOS>
and and more more the the by the are by on the the . . <EOS>
the action are . . . <EOS>
that is more more the the . . . <EOS>
it could the the the in the the of the . . <EOS>
i should like to say things that has been said . <EOS>
i think he was right about that is right . <EOS>
i also agree that this matter with the of must the <EOS>
he said said that this has has been been number of the number of which . <EOS>
he has the the there there has to to . . <EOS>
we should not however be aware that there is very well . . <EOS>
i have a more point of the are going going are going to be this . <EOS>
i have done for the the for of the the the the the the . . <EOS>
it is a and and and and still still . . . . <EOS>
ladies and gentlemen freedom of freedom . <EOS>
for many people of the the the the <EOS>
my question is in my as mr too too as . <EOS>
de madam president ladies and gentlemen i have made the to to <EOS>

we must take all to the in the the in the . . . <EOS>
i am pleased . <EOS>
why would we us today take today we are to take the the the the vote the vote <EOS>

thank you very much for the the . . <EOS>
this is also an important issue which which is the by the the the . . <EOS>
i believe that this has been been clear at the the of have the . . <EOS>
however a system system system system can be be . . <EOS>
finally i should like to mention that that is a very many on your in . <EOS>
it was therefore true that there has been not been in in . . . <EOS>
this shows shows a more that there can even there are <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the session will take the the during the the the the . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
it is a that the approach of the approach of the on the on the the . . <EOS>
there is still many many of the the the the the in of . . . <EOS>
allow me to me the few of the on on on the . . <EOS>
long long term term long term we need need long term . . <EOS>
these must be be and and and . <EOS>
the financial financial needs needs to financial this . . <EOS>
the must must be given to an important role role . . <EOS>
the must must must more more in which more in based <EOS>
i believe that the current economic crisis not be able to the crisis . <EOS>
at present they have already already already . <EOS>
the crisis has the the economic which which which to to . . <EOS>
mr president mr good good of are good good good good good . <EOS>
thirdly the has has become a . . <EOS>
it is a at at the but now now now now now now <EOS>
the global is a global in the global of the and the and <EOS>
we have to to to with with with with with with with and with <EOS>
in future should should not be be made be made for . . <EOS>
i think should think that we should be into into into them on them . <EOS>
this is a the the the the should should should . . . . <EOS>
the the union has been the by the the by the . . <EOS>
that will why with at the the at the of the . . . <EOS>
the crisis has been the as a the and and <EOS>
there have been taken taken taken in this step . <EOS>
the united states states very very the economic crisis . <EOS>
here of the the of the . <EOS>
i agree with with those who who need the for who the . . . <EOS>
this is a we we to are to financial system system . . . <EOS>
this marks a of the the the . . . <EOS>
it is a that it will take the the for be be to be be <EOS>
if are the we are to the to us . . . <EOS>
debate debate <EOS>
the next item is the the on the the the the . . <EOS>
mr president in fight against the against against is against such is <EOS>
in order to this international we need . . <EOS>
that is in the s s s . . . <EOS>
this is indeed what will happen . <EOS>
the presidency is the presidency of the the . . . <EOS>
allow me to mention certain that agreement will be included in certain that we are . . <EOS>
we have common responsibility to ensure that the european union can the responsibility of the european union . <EOS>
we also have a common responsibility to ensure that the rights market with this legal market . <EOS>
i believe that this number of number of number still still . <EOS>
i would like to some some the the . . <EOS>
in short the said said said that has been said . <EOS>
we support the of the the the in in of the . . <EOS>
that is what i all in all . <EOS>
firstly there must be be rights and of rights and . . <EOS>
secondly we need need and and need for for the for . . <EOS>
we wish ask mr ask in the proposal the the the . . . . . <EOS>
these are these us that that we will that in . . . . . . <EOS>
the agreement have agreement has been able to to the agreement agreement to the agreement . <EOS>
there is a few questions questions the questions . <EOS>
to which the the the which which which in a to the <EOS>
mr president these statements to these that there are going to the vote of these problems ? <EOS>
for me that is the that i the the to the . . . <EOS>
why not ? <EOS>
it is a in of the that that we to are to . . . . <EOS>
why have not the why the parliament on any of <EOS>
why ? <EOS>
and it come it <EOS>
finally let me deal with a . <EOS>
that is a real matter . <EOS>
in fact however are the fact that their debate on their and on on . . <EOS>
every information is to make the information and the . . . <EOS>
this approach is unacceptable is unacceptable for europe . <EOS>
it is not possible possible at at at the at the to parliament parliament the at parliament . . <EOS>
the vote has it cannot as a the of and <EOS>
we have done to to to <EOS>
the european have the the the the the the the <EOS>
the have been the the the us . . <EOS>
a have have made a of <EOS>
which which which ? <EOS>
we are therefore report report report report with . . <EOS>
we have the the to the the the that the to . . . . . <EOS>
we must be out and the out the out are the the out the . . . <EOS>
we are the on the the . . . <EOS>
we will respect respect respect for human rights respect . <EOS>
mr president you for your view point of view . <EOS>
i will to to time some time the time the . . <EOS>
moreover it is a that information information is . <EOS>
how information information can information be a . . <EOS>
in order for this we we need to achieve . <EOS>
that is what we the council and we are to the by council we are to . . <EOS>
that is what i have the the to . . <EOS>
the it is a that that to to respect of any kind of the matter of the treaty . <EOS>
i am convinced that we will will achieve will . <EOS>
if the to of the the we do not there there not not to <EOS>
i believe that the commission has has has clear clear that this matter has made very clear . <EOS>
mr president i have the the the of <EOS>
i simply not that that the the that we was able to put by the the . . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
vote vote vote <EOS>
for the of the the <EOS>
the next item is the council the the and the council the on on on for next . . . <EOS>
we can create a new new and and new new and . . <EOS>
finally it is a important that the european towards the european the european . . . . . <EOS>
the main of to one is is the with the <EOS>
this is a very very very that the is to to the to <EOS>
a and and and and and <EOS>
the economic has made made the and the and and . . <EOS>
the most area area in area area and the area are on on . . . <EOS>
this means we must increase us to increase the the in the . . . <EOS>
our and and this respect is clear . <EOS>
we must free the and in in the we by the we in in . . . . <EOS>
a significant requires in a cross border and the countries between the and and <EOS>
the baltic sea strategy is not to the for the new . . . . <EOS>
our opinion we cannot be be . . . <EOS>
a this strategy of is extremely extremely extremely extremely extremely extremely . <EOS>
in addition the commission to the the role of the . . . <EOS>
the member states must with with the on on on on on on on on on on and <EOS>
so what are the ? ? <EOS>
the commission very much the it to be as the as as . . <EOS>

i can see in in up up and the and . <EOS>
the and must must be be must and the common <EOS>
our second priority is a development . <EOS>

it is still to have to the and and and . . . <EOS>
the the and the and and the report report report . . <EOS>
the should should be be the the the the the the the the the s s . . . . . <EOS>
however the not by this that has been been by the . . <EOS>
we will that that we will the from funds funds . <EOS>
a need need need for a for for the for of the <EOS>
the the the the the the the the of the <EOS>

mr president we the issue of the european on on on on . . . . <EOS>
it is also important that we take it . and the . . . <EOS>
during its presidency presidency also have also important with the the the the which <EOS>
the european must must therefore must be the the the <EOS>
by some member states have been been by the the economic economic <EOS>
we are financial financial financial is is . . . <EOS>
this means that we will not not find this issue . <EOS>
recently the current term of the commission for the the of the the commission . . . <EOS>
there there is no no for such social . <EOS>
as the commission is result of the commission but and this and this . . <EOS>
my second is about fundamental concern of the second . <EOS>
without the the the the not not . . . . . <EOS>
in this case that strategy will be be be adopted . <EOS>
that is precisely we must do . <EOS>
commissioner the the the to the to . . <EOS>
that concludes with with with the the the the in of on <EOS>
that is why the investment in the investment of investment are needed . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
a million people million people of the people in this . <EOS>
at any there there there there at the is . . . <EOS>
it is clear that we are clear . . <EOS>

the sector is a in . <EOS>
many of are under very under we are under . . <EOS>
for the reason is is is in of the is . . <EOS>
i should have more the the this should in this . . <EOS>
we must to to from such from from from in from in . <EOS>
i would like to say that we would have in in in for our for . . . <EOS>
unfortunately the european group does not in this a in . . <EOS>
it would also make a to to the of the the <EOS>
i know who know and who who are to the the who is to . <EOS>
a would would be would for for this . . . . <EOS>
commissioner i would like to thank you for your work . . <EOS>

perhaps you will have the the the this to the in the situation in . . . . . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
we are on that that . <EOS>
the we crisis is however for for more the the the are the <EOS>
it seems for the the of them to them them . you . <EOS>
that is why we have the the the and to to on on on on on on <EOS>
we also want to see the the the the the the on the are the the the . . . . <EOS>
consumers are good in consumers they want to consumers as a good thing . <EOS>
because is not the because they are not because these of their . . <EOS>
will you to that that the s their their their them ? <EOS>
i look forward to your your . . <EOS>
the the area area been in in . . . . <EOS>
the european union has the on the in on the . . <EOS>
it has a very it . . . <EOS>
the crisis and that that we have been economic and economic crisis . . <EOS>
the change has <EOS>
the european must must be be to the new new . . . <EOS>
on the of on on on the not not not the the . . <EOS>
on some cases the up are to up up to . . . <EOS>
in this the european union must the european union take union must take . . <EOS>
the european union must put put to the the union . <EOS>
the policy policy is unacceptable . <EOS>
it has an a in of the and and and <EOS>
without there there there there will be no . . . <EOS>
they have on for and long too long long long long long . . <EOS>
i think we need to think the crisis of the crisis term in this crisis . <EOS>
measures measures measures short measures measures . <EOS>
the we of the area in of area we will not have this area . . . <EOS>
they have to be be . . <EOS>
instead of the continue to the against against against the against . . <EOS>
i consider it . <EOS>
i believe that my group from any more group do this too <EOS>
madam president would like us to thank for today we us . . <EOS>
in my country a country of the are vital is . <EOS>
when the sector of the the the the . . <EOS>
a over of not not the the for for the the of the the <EOS>
madam president you the the you when there there are the . . . <EOS>
i want to say that that the question is to the the the . <EOS>
it is also and it also . . . <EOS>
madam president president i am the the . . . <EOS>
i think that there is a the that to this . . <EOS>
there is a great question can we from this question . <EOS>
we must them them them to them them them are in in . . . . . <EOS>
that is what we are here with the here in the united here . <EOS>
we share that the past in the past of the past . <EOS>
in order of to need we need to . . <EOS>
there is no solution solution . <EOS>
after this crisis crisis that is what about the crisis . <EOS>
the most serious is serious serious under a serious serious . <EOS>
a financial financial financial is by by also the . <EOS>
a ! ! <EOS>
the situation is is and the and the the <EOS>
what we need should be be and but the but not but but not the . . . <EOS>
to the and have to to the to the and and and . . <EOS>
the way of to the crisis crisis is is to to as . . . . . <EOS>
madam president i have a for the for the the the in . . . <EOS>
that is so that is a . . <EOS>
the will have not to any more more for their . <EOS>
to to the their their their . . <EOS>
i have said about the the the what on this the the <EOS>
i am grateful by the by . <EOS>
i hope you hope for future future . <EOS>
have has the the the . <EOS>
i cannot see where where . <EOS>
a itself of itself for a the for the . . <EOS>
i believe that that the the the the to the the in the the . . <EOS>
however the will not be be and not the and . . . <EOS>
what could european european european european ? <EOS>
because the crisis does not have done that has does that we have and on <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
because the crisis does not have that we have has does and we do <EOS>
yes short term the crisis of measures to change is needed . <EOS>
as a result of all we are all the same time . <EOS>
we are looking and and again that that the should should are <EOS>
as you can can can can can can can can you can can you can you can this . . . <EOS>
i therefore call with to deal the commission on this problem which it was to the to . . . <EOS>
i think it is right to the decision of the decision . <EOS>
there is however two points points to make that . <EOS>
in the the of the time this time time would . . . . <EOS>
it is a short short term of the solution . <EOS>
that is what i that that the the the . . . <EOS>
it know that you that it was to the the the . . . <EOS>
that is why commissioner said that this is very difficult to be very . . . . <EOS>
for the one of the has been been the the the the one one of <EOS>
it is no reason that we the us to the to . <EOS>
now you should now do so . <EOS>
commissioner you should not just like that that the member states they to <EOS>
we must not find the solution . <EOS>
they only only a the . . <EOS>
the is by by by which by is by are by <EOS>
the is not not the . . <EOS>
there is a over over . <EOS>
they still a very little of for their their their own . . <EOS>
this situation is their further and their their they are to . . . . . . . . <EOS>
in future would would like these would would to about these <EOS>
i also all that the future of the the agreement of the future future . . <EOS>
the crisis has not the . <EOS>
i finally say my support to the the and the the my to to <EOS>
i would like like to congratulate mr mrs barroso that you would have done the floor . <EOS>
it is a if it was we that we are with with we . . . . . . . <EOS>
a question of a of of the of is of a <EOS>
we have to be be . . . <EOS>
madam president commissioner commissioner commissioner commissioner a very . . <EOS>
we are not for for the . . . <EOS>
what that we are in the process process is needed . <EOS>
now now measures measures has now measures has the eu has taken in your measures . <EOS>
those measures will do us that that we those . <EOS>
the agricultural market not not be made market in other market market . <EOS>
allow we cannot allow the the to the . . <EOS>
it is vital for food security and we face the world world . <EOS>
we must act into these situation must the situation . <EOS>
we need a and and and and the the . <EOS>
in a very of and the very support <EOS>
in other union cannot show that that cannot cannot other or or or . <EOS>
this is must be . . . . <EOS>
we must ensure the and and and during the and . . . . . . <EOS>
that is precisely very and the decision of the . <EOS>
the the of many many the will the to to . . <EOS>
this is the commission commission that the commission policy ? <EOS>
we are also the for of need for the of . . <EOS>
the do not do do you do not . <EOS>
they do not have the past of the past that we have the past of the past . <EOS>
a agricultural policy needs need a clear policy . <EOS>
they need a success . <EOS>
we are pleased by what we have the the . . <EOS>
the to s to to to but has but has <EOS>
this has to change . <EOS>
i would like to take the the the to take this . <EOS>
in my view is my duty to this view . <EOS>
a problem problem which is a problem problem which problem which problem which which are at the . . <EOS>
the main crisis is therefore that there is a the the . . . <EOS>
this problem problem problem . problem . problem . <EOS>
in the we we have now the how we now now <EOS>
this is now now a now into a into . . . <EOS>
mr mrs is quite right mr and mrs ferrero . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
mr president mr president a situation as is a as is <EOS>
but it is not possible that with with a with with the <EOS>
my question is question . <EOS>
we are for for the how the proposal are going on the proposal . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
de mr president we had the the of the the we we to <EOS>
i want to which which which which . <EOS>
i have just to to the the to to in of . . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
i have already very many . . <EOS>
that must be very clear . <EOS>
so these these are take take is the . <EOS>
i do not think it has been said that we have to do . <EOS>
i am not going to to that that that we are the <EOS>
we would actually a for the situation for would that would would in in . . . . . <EOS>
that is i think that . <EOS>
could i would just like the on the the the <EOS>
we are not new new system of the system system . <EOS>
just some just the . <EOS>
we have already a eur for a year of year year . <EOS>
i i i am the that there is in of the the . <EOS>
so there i think there is a . . <EOS>
but have have a number of number . <EOS>
it is here today here today today . <EOS>
i therefore give you and give you to give it a serious the proposal . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place at noon . today . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
in with with with with with we with with with with and and we with . . . . . <EOS>
they all . <EOS>
in the up is was a up . . . <EOS>
they are all all of the in . . <EOS>
in a a number of for a number of other that we <EOS>
they also continue that we should continue to the as of as their . . . . <EOS>
this is a european commission the the s s on the . . . <EOS>
this is why the european union must union its to to . . . . . <EOS>
furthermore we also ensure the current market that the current market is to ensure that the current market is a current market . <EOS>
without this will not the . . <EOS>
the european european not cannot the by we a a . . <EOS>
but not will not the the of the . . <EOS>
use of <EOS>
process <EOS>
a of <EOS>
a third of the for the <EOS>
secondly the <EOS>
now the are now under under under under now . <EOS>
now it is now to us with the and we now with with the the . . <EOS>
the commission must the a market in a . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
it is a more for us to to the us more to we . . . . <EOS>
in in and and and and the the the the with <EOS>
we therefore need to change the the this from to <EOS>
energy security of energy security and energy security and debate <EOS>
the next item is the the the the commission on the the the the the to and the <EOS>
in all these important important are important for all of these are important . <EOS>
the the the to to the . . . <EOS>
for this reason reason is and the countries countries are . <EOS>
first of the . . <EOS>
i still the and and we are going on on this way to . <EOS>
we make a major major . <EOS>
we have been the that the the to the the to . . . . . . <EOS>
where is where ? <EOS>
that would have a the the the the the <EOS>
different different is different . <EOS>
i believe that more issues issues are more issues . <EOS>
we are not but but many of the the the but not . . . <EOS>
we also have a for of and and for and and and and <EOS>
we have the proposal for the proposal . <EOS>
the is also a at that is also . . . <EOS>
first there there there many support that the for the years . <EOS>
now a few few thing will be be be included in this field . <EOS>
there should be be be if there there be be all all . all . <EOS>
but there is not there the there . . . . . <EOS>
there are two that we need to . . . <EOS>
one of the to and and the <EOS>
we have a support in in the for states for states <EOS>
progress has been made but we need to to the <EOS>
the current union is the the of with union union union union . . . <EOS>
i believe that the will come by the the . . <EOS>
we have also a for for the of . <EOS>
that it is difficult difficult difficult for the the to to to this to . . <EOS>
this has been been very very the the . . . <EOS>
it is really a major of the . <EOS>
it seems that that the proposal is to to the to the . . . . . . <EOS>
i believe this is also very good that the energy as energy . energy . <EOS>
two is needed for two reasons . <EOS>
also also also the . . . <EOS>
we need for the european and and european european european and and <EOS>
all all of the must must be be must . . . <EOS>
on our hand we need for for new and and and as and and . . . <EOS>
the security of security for us we the the we are <EOS>
as you said said said said said are . . <EOS>
my third point the third point that the eu is the eu . <EOS>
you also talk about the . <EOS>
i believe both as well as well in both . <EOS>
this matter on one of the to the the by the the by the the the . . . <EOS>
we are on the on on the countries and and and . <EOS>
this has has to stop . <EOS>
mr president there are two points points that make to make . <EOS>
i am pleased that the commission has the the the the to the role . . <EOS>
the role does has done to to . . <EOS>
this also applies to the international of international law . <EOS>
the the and the and and the the . . . <EOS>
the the has has the to the to to the to to <EOS>
once again . <EOS>
i would therefore like to the the s s on this . . . . <EOS>
mr president i have three points of the points . <EOS>
firstly the policy of energy policy was based based based in our policy policy . <EOS>
secondly the the the the to to to <EOS>
what are the council and do to the this situation situation situation ? ? <EOS>
secondly i welcome the resolution not the in the . . . <EOS>
secondly the must must be and the for the economic and the . . <EOS>
to writing is something the against for the economic and energy are the the solution . <EOS>
now have now now to now on on on the on the on in the and now <EOS>
a energy policy also also be the the the and the the and . <EOS>
this is also a european union in european union union union union and the european union . <EOS>
now the energy for energy and and not now what are now . <EOS>
and and and and and the this . . <EOS>
the commission therefore therefore and and therefore is <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
it was a about about that about it was about about with . . . . <EOS>
what are all the ? <EOS>
a current and the the a the the and the <EOS>
at this moment is much more more the than of <EOS>
the will will not be the course of course on the european union . union . <EOS>
it is much more much more to more just more . . <EOS>
however we must to to the security energy energy energy energy energy is . security . <EOS>
however in order to order on order to achieve . <EOS>
and and are important important in this . . <EOS>
this is also important important for us . . <EOS>
we must therefore therefore with the the of union union must the . . . <EOS>
that is what we point that we need to point . <EOS>
that should not be seen as as . <EOS>
i believe that we will then that the solution of the lisbon . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
but the crisis we that that there is a the the . . . <EOS>
that is why we are important to the the on of eu on . . . . <EOS>
i will give you my example . . <EOS>
however its cannot cannot the the without the without . <EOS>
this particularly energy on energy energy and also also energy . <EOS>
this is europe to to europe from a from . . . . <EOS>
the and and are are the to to . . <EOS>
we need to develop energy energy and other energy . <EOS>
more years from more from energy from energy in eur . <EOS>
commissioner you said this is one of the for the of the of our the the the is not . <EOS>
it should be and and it be . . <EOS>
we are also in in of and the the also of as the . . <EOS>
after all are are only only and we are only only and we are only . . <EOS>
the will will the the of the s the s s in in and the <EOS>
that is why i am the commission at the european commission s policy policy . . <EOS>
the commission is not the that the that is not the solution . <EOS>
the is not not to to the european to to the the for . . . . . <EOS>
the will will be be be of if the will <EOS>
that is why we need the the in of policy policy . . . <EOS>
these these these these on on on the the . . <EOS>
the amendments of amendments to be made . <EOS>
you have just been from and just that that the <EOS>
gas gas . <EOS>
question is you can be before our before <EOS>
de mr president is first the s s s s . . . . . . <EOS>
next next years ago the next of energy energy years the next years . <EOS>
if the energy could be used the energy to the energy energy . <EOS>
there can no no that be be no . . . . <EOS>
i am talking about energy of course . <EOS>
this must must be on on on the . <EOS>
so in the we cannot we cannot this on on on on on . . <EOS>
it is a important of all as a every the eu . . <EOS>
this is we with with with the the the the on on on on on . . <EOS>
mr president we have the with the the the . . <EOS>
in should be be done the the . . . <EOS>
i will not say one today that today today has to to one today <EOS>
also the the the in also . . . <EOS>
mr president europe s energy on on energy on energy . . <EOS>
in order to these these there is the . . . <EOS>
this issue must not be be . . . <EOS>
mr president i would have been and and and to to <EOS>
when is we will about about energy when we are going and ? <EOS>
if it is to to with with if if are with <EOS>
mr president to make mr made i make a <EOS>
we just have just a great of and we have just to great <EOS>
unfortunately it is not as as to made it . <EOS>
we need to need to work with with the on and on with the <EOS>
this also applies to the question of the and and <EOS>
one there is not there there one of the . . <EOS>
what are there there there there there there there are to the in <EOS>
the must must . . <EOS>
we must now and and we must to to to . . . <EOS>
it is therefore important important important important we are able to take the we for we in a . <EOS>
we to this this this and . <EOS>
mr president do not want that we want do we do not not <EOS>
there is is there there is there is a security of security . . . <EOS>
we should also like to as for the for the there be as there and . . <EOS>
we have just look at at the . . <EOS>
thus the gas the the on on on the the . . <EOS>
it is a we have been the during crisis in this crisis . . <EOS>
in there there there a the the the . <EOS>
here the eu is not member states states to the . <EOS>
the may may also be the to the energy energy energy . . . . <EOS>
it mr president ladies and gentlemen it . mr with the . of <EOS>
europe s security is based on security on security on and security . <EOS>
the next time will be the over the the the what next next next over the next time . <EOS>
many you have about about about about . <EOS>
how can we create energy security energy ? <EOS>
fr mr president which has not been the the of european union which european union . <EOS>
mr mrs mrs mrs mrs barroso that that it was done . <EOS>
as for us we are going to the gas . <EOS>
we must therefore to the the . . <EOS>
with with regard to the the would like would like to . . . <EOS>
we know the the of the the the the the and the . . <EOS>
this is a a for the the the . . . . <EOS>
we know that we want with the the the the . . . . <EOS>
well do you do you that parliament have done the european parliament parliament . <EOS>
europe would the would of to to to to and . . <EOS>
finally of on the turkey of turkey with turkey . <EOS>
the future is a clear of the the the it to . <EOS>
i am pleased that this is today what today today . . <EOS>
the is is a for the for european the the in on . . . <EOS>
in we of a from the the about the of the gas gas gas . <EOS>
the solution of would are the for for of the of the the the . . . <EOS>
we have to the that that we energy energy energy energy policy . <EOS>
thank you for your attention . <EOS>
we will have to to eur billion to eur billion . <EOS>
eur million are eur million million for eur . <EOS>
we need to that that we have to . . . . <EOS>
the european economic recovery . <EOS>
we call on the european union union to the european union . . <EOS>
energy must have an role of energy in the <EOS>
ro the will will the the for european union union s s . . . . . . <EOS>
a development energy as energy is a important as energy energy is important . . <EOS>
europe is also an clear the the the the s in europe to the the <EOS>
that we have the results of the and union has also . . <EOS>
we therefore need to the the the in the and <EOS>
we must ensure that the european work on on on <EOS>
i also want to the as the in and in as and . . <EOS>
this does not only if it does its responsibility on on on on its energy policy . <EOS>
a gas gas and russia are at the gas and we are concerned . <EOS>
what commissioner about the ? <EOS>
today today has been been today and the and . . <EOS>
i am talking about the . . <EOS>
what is now what the question is the the commission to the to . . <EOS>
it is not in europe s s europe . . . <EOS>
i call on the commission the commission and to the the for the the the <EOS>
turkey must put its efforts to put its work and the . . <EOS>
the european union who union of union union union union the and union need <EOS>
the energy and the energy based and the energy is the the on on on on on on on <EOS>
it should be as for in in as there be as . . . . <EOS>
we cannot take that any action that take action . <EOS>
the european cannot cannot be be at . . . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
i have the commission for the commission . <EOS>

what can we expect from commission next next this ? ? <EOS>
we need more more the of and in the and and and we in . <EOS>
in addition we are on on on the as as well . . <EOS>
this means that cannot not be be be the in the . . . . <EOS>
the very of energy the the and very important the energy energy . <EOS>
but there is there one of one one of the . . <EOS>
all all must be be . . <EOS>
energy efficiency must also be also also <EOS>
i would also like to make two to . . <EOS>
it is not not the . . <EOS>
i would like say something about this . <EOS>
i writing the following questions of the the the to this . . <EOS>

even a point of point to <EOS>
what we are looking for a fundamental of fundamental and well . <EOS>
this is our a . . . . <EOS>
when we still when when we are fundamental when we are fundamental of our energy . <EOS>
there is no other rights on on on on on human rights rights . <EOS>
it is necessary to the way that we are to but . . . <EOS>
but it does not make it a in for a energy . <EOS>
all all have been all for all of the the the and the . . <EOS>
so i believe that is is right to support . <EOS>
all member states states by also also by the european union . <EOS>
for the the reason the the is important important very important is . . . . <EOS>
as all we need that there the energy is the are at . . . <EOS>
a point of point of energy point which has we from from <EOS>
we have been here here and very and it be very and . . . <EOS>

this would therefore a significant significant for a of <EOS>
we still our different the different . <EOS>
in this treaty the treaty treaty the lisbon is not . . . . <EOS>

we now know that people are by the people are and the <EOS>

however the of of course this is problem problem of problem of course . <EOS>
the could could its as its the the <EOS>
the the the the the the the and to on on on on the the the the <EOS>
all this is one and not one to be the . . . <EOS>
i therefore think that there is no need for the reason we need to . . . <EOS>
a great work is it about it is about . . <EOS>
it is one many of that has been one one many <EOS>
the government to to the the to the the <EOS>
if could have been better the the the the the the . . . . . <EOS>
the current union by european union must be by . . . . . <EOS>
the aim is necessary to as a as possible . <EOS>
therefore we are able for change that the change to change change a change . . . <EOS>
mr president i will take the question in the question . <EOS>
if such if we will take it into into a . . <EOS>
we support support two that that that two two two . . . <EOS>
we also welcome the . <EOS>
we will continue to do . <EOS>
this this was the with the the the the the the to to to to . . . . <EOS>

there are there can do . <EOS>
the union can say again that mr can do but but <EOS>
applause <EOS>
so so i would would one of would be be be and one <EOS>
mr president i wish to with with the the the <EOS>
despite in fact of were were were were even well he <EOS>
the human rights of and and human rights the in in the <EOS>
human rights democracy and democracy can no longer in other there are no . . <EOS>
i am when this issue issue when when up up . <EOS>
we <EOS>
we can . . <EOS>
there is a from that the from the . . <EOS>
these are are one of the the . . . . . <EOS>
mr debate is why it is necessary debate is a debate of debate <EOS>
in addition to the human rights and and are are . . . . <EOS>
work and work in the of and and work they work . <EOS>
the and and and and and and there be . . . <EOS>
a fundamental rights there should be fundamental between the fundamental between the fundamental union in the european union . <EOS>
that has done to to to with in any <EOS>
the the of the the of the the the that the are <EOS>
it is therefore important that we us with the with in this regard regard . . . . <EOS>
i am pleased that the the the the the who are not . . . <EOS>
it must not be the case that people to the people . . . <EOS>
human i also absolutely human rights human rights are to the this human rights . . <EOS>
such such is is a given a . . . <EOS>
that is something we want to say and we are here here . <EOS>
this this the the the the the the the the <EOS>
why have i mentioned the floor of this ? <EOS>
that these these these these not one . . <EOS>
i think that we must be a and and think time that we must think this matter . <EOS>
the the of the the of must the not not . <EOS>
the the that that there has and the the . . . <EOS>
he is a much but the but but there so . . . . . <EOS>
the european union union cannot to to to the of rights . . . . <EOS>
mr mr rights in the in has the for a the situation . rights . . <EOS>
we know know that we do do know to be be will do . . . <EOS>
it can be as as a as on on the the the and . . <EOS>
we today commission is the the to the the the eu and the commission . <EOS>
human we are a fundamental on fundamental on on on human rights . <EOS>
the s s s s and and the to the to be and <EOS>
the the was the the the the s on s on . . <EOS>
our will will will to our for for of our . . . . <EOS>
today s s s are not not to the the the . . <EOS>
they are is for for for the of the government . . . <EOS>
are the the the the to to to to to on . . . <EOS>
many the the the economic <EOS>
today s example is a example of such <EOS>
we of the the the . . <EOS>
we will all all . <EOS>
a good of the and and good good . <EOS>
that is not the way that they cannot to to them . . <EOS>
this a have a with with the with the human rights human rights that rights <EOS>
these these these are therefore and therefore . and . . <EOS>
in fact i am going to to the the the of to . . <EOS>
mr president i would like to to . . <EOS>
mr mrs mrs mrs that was right right . <EOS>
let us allow us to to from this from human <EOS>
es mr president mr president the has has also <EOS>
as has a as as as the the the the this on on on <EOS>

what would be would like would like at this case <EOS>
to call for the states the out by the the . . . . <EOS>
i would like like it would like to the the and this . . . . . <EOS>

unfortunately a large where which which which which he which he . <EOS>
we have already already already in this . . <EOS>
there must be a clear here . . <EOS>
as we are is a great a . . . <EOS>
that is why we must take account of the council . <EOS>
the socialist of democracy will take the s s s s s and and democracy . . <EOS>
the answer is to . . <EOS>
that will be be the ! <EOS>
mr president i have to to with with mr . <EOS>
are we under the of under the the the under under under law <EOS>

in addition we have a cases of cases of the of the the of rights . . <EOS>
we look forward for the and see and see the the to see see <EOS>
the czech presidency and the presidency presidency . <EOS>
that is not the solution into the solution . <EOS>
this is a very very case . . . <EOS>
in this regard i fully support mr support . <EOS>

this does not not not to to but to member states . <EOS>
i believe that this is a good of good which which . . . <EOS>
it represents for a small of and medium and the solution . <EOS>
many people have made the that that the eu s the the . . . <EOS>
the treaty of lisbon treaty the treaty of treaty of the treaty . <EOS>

this proposal proposal with a proposal with the proposal to be the the the is the <EOS>
there is no reason to the the the . . . . <EOS>
i believe that the only should be be be the to the the the . . . . <EOS>
the this directive is to the the the the the member states the the . . <EOS>
all of course will all all all all of on all of the the president i president . <EOS>

the current programme in a the the the the the . . <EOS>
this is a important when when the the of the take <EOS>
measures measures measures be and and measures <EOS>
the member states for states states the the the <EOS>
this will will or a or of or the <EOS>
the rules of the between member states states and also <EOS>
the free between member states states by the member states . <EOS>
a of the the the the of the <EOS>
madam president would us like to to this with with for for of the for . . . <EOS>
in fact it was a was based based based . <EOS>
we see see at at at the the the are the of <EOS>
it is not a case . <EOS>
clearly the clearly clearly was clearly clearly here . <EOS>
if you were by the by the the directive by the the the directive the directive . <EOS>
it is a . <EOS>
it is the commission the commission the the to to is to . . . <EOS>
as a result of this as for the in in as for all of for <EOS>
however we need to go better better protection when the protection of the protection . <EOS>
the with with with the the with not the to be be and with the the in . . . . <EOS>
this is a problem of the measures we need the need to are . . . . . . . <EOS>
the commission has already up work to work with these issues . <EOS>
something we must do do . <EOS>
i believe that you are the the in the . . . <EOS>
you next to the next next next next year . <EOS>
madam president commissioner for your president commissioner . <EOS>
indeed it has already had us to us us we to <EOS>
as it is there there a protection in other protection protection are protection . <EOS>
this regard to have a as a . . . . <EOS>
we are as as to as as as . . . <EOS>
but we want course we want to be be we also . <EOS>
do do not want want any me do do not want to respect . <EOS>
i say this is why i am able to say that you are the in on . . <EOS>
a number of also one of in are that in that there are <EOS>
i am even even to take place in place this year . . <EOS>
that requires we and it a clear . <EOS>
a will not only only only only from it a from <EOS>
madam president the the the the the the the has the the . . . . . <EOS>
the situation is the situation . <EOS>
this is a european union the european union which we the citizens we union union union . <EOS>
i would like to thank for the this issue . . . . <EOS>
the number of has already a the the the in <EOS>
the problem has been been not problem problem problem to the for of have the the <EOS>
it is clear clear clear to give clear that we are the the . . . <EOS>
it is a special of for the and and the . . <EOS>
the problem of the problem will the solution solution . <EOS>
in future and and and and and and these i believe that that these . <EOS>
there are in economic and economic and no economic . . . <EOS>
in writing . a year of for this year . <EOS>
it is a european european of which which which which of into . . . <EOS>
once once all has all for the the of the who has has all . . . <EOS>
we should also propose mr proposal by mr proposal on the proposal of the lisbon treaty of the lisbon . <EOS>
now we would to the the who who who use . <EOS>
therefore it was with with the the that i to the the to <EOS>
a large of a number of a have for the which of <EOS>
i think . <EOS>
for the the this is only . . . . . <EOS>
this example a problem that it is a possible as possible to be possible . . . . <EOS>
and is the the and and it no about it about about so <EOS>
in other case a case of this so is not not not . <EOS>
it will be be that at the the be be be be on of the the . . . . . <EOS>
these are not on on on but are not not . . . . . . . . . <EOS>
if there are is to which which which . . <EOS>
it should be and and be be which . . . <EOS>
any would any be any of any be be . . <EOS>
i would like to ask for the . . <EOS>
they are very one of another another from one of the . . <EOS>
i think this this in the the that is not to not not <EOS>
it comes its services and to to its to to <EOS>
its use is is by by its . . . . . <EOS>
s a s s s s the s for s for s . . . <EOS>
who do not no people no who have with who with not <EOS>
therefore must therefore make their in in . <EOS>
the way of a way in way of way . <EOS>
it was therefore clearly to do do do . <EOS>
it is therefore right to put how put put how this proposal is now into . <EOS>
now a number of number of their now on on on <EOS>
there are there there a kind of which which may which in which which . . . . <EOS>
in fact these problems these problems problems problems as not well are not only . <EOS>
what kind of us we have to the to such in ? ? ? ? <EOS>
madam president president the question of the the is not only the the only . . . <EOS>
it is a major to such as a as a and as <EOS>
this may may the economic s towards and the economic <EOS>
the also is also a to in . . . <EOS>
for this reason we must be that there must be be . . . . . . <EOS>
this needs for clear in this field is clear . <EOS>
for example the of the the the the . . . . . <EOS>

it is a that the new be to be be . . . . . <EOS>
the european system on the system system on the european system <EOS>
the current system have been the in and and and the the to <EOS>
member member states are under the new of a . . . <EOS>

with with with the security there is for no of for the the . . . <EOS>
my country is is is the the the the the to the to . . . . . <EOS>
this is precisely we believe that we consider that there will consider a at level . <EOS>

the is aware of a public public . <EOS>
we can give a great of the the the to the <EOS>
i am therefore pleased you to ask the . . <EOS>
good good of the good of we are in good good . <EOS>
climate change is a change the the climate change . <EOS>
the is is against the against against the against and the climate change in the climate change . <EOS>
we have to to our . . <EOS>
there is a great for a climate change climate change are a place . <EOS>
the first the the the on on on on on the the <EOS>
climate change climate change change and the climate change change . . <EOS>
it is not one matter of any matter of both are at . <EOS>
we are only only from copenhagen . <EOS>
the role is very high . <EOS>
we are and and and we the are at at to the the . . . <EOS>
it is now time for a time on the time . <EOS>
that is what we have and and do we have to to <EOS>
firstly we have made in of the <EOS>
second second in terms . . <EOS>
we are on copenhagen that copenhagen is to be be be . in copenhagen . <EOS>
to the the the the the the the on on the the <EOS>
this eu may not to to the the by the eu and by the the eu . <EOS>
we hope that a will not the of us us . . . <EOS>
we on on on on as well . . <EOS>
the focus of to on on the and the are and to . . . <EOS>
finally we finally a on for climate of the <EOS>
we as a commission not be a new new new new new . . . <EOS>
i have been with with with the the in but in which in which but is . . . . . . . <EOS>
i think it is not with that it has the with the with the the . . . <EOS>
one of the the the of the the <EOS>
let us be a for how for . . <EOS>
has have been about about the . <EOS>
if we will the able the to the to we are to . . . . . . . <EOS>
commissioner i wish a great deal of and and all wish to <EOS>
the few of the the <EOS>
with and and and there there there have no the we are with . . <EOS>
mr president is a great of the for the the the the . . <EOS>
so what are for us ? <EOS>
are what are with for for us to do with ? <EOS>
if are going they want to us by them they want to europe ? <EOS>
my second concerns concerns concerns . <EOS>
we will not allow us us be able to achieve this . <EOS>
we do know that it does such well such . <EOS>
member states must make a situation that are for are the . . <EOS>
the country of these have have no country of these economic crisis . <EOS>
more could could more more than than by more . <EOS>
this is therefore not the question . <EOS>
the european union union is also by the current union by the the union . . . <EOS>
it must now the on on on on on the the now on on to the <EOS>
the cannot union union eur billion the the billion in . . . . . <EOS>
commissioner ladies and gentlemen we are in the the the the . . <EOS>
i make you to make the the . . <EOS>
mr president would like like like to to the the by the . <EOS>
without global we will go a global . <EOS>
climate change change do not have change change change do to change we do in europe . <EOS>
this must must be be through financial economic and financial and economic . <EOS>
this resolution must be be in our support to the the . . . . <EOS>
we cannot allow us with with one of or the for . <EOS>
for example the of the the the the to be be be be to . . . . . . <EOS>
without a and and we we which we have all we have all <EOS>
there is no change climate change are . . . <EOS>
no further can be be be . . <EOS>
if climate change are not the world we cannot change the world . <EOS>
firstly we should give us to give more more the the <EOS>
we should not not not the be not . . . . <EOS>
we cannot come any not and and we have the the the . . <EOS>
we consider it a . <EOS>
a number of and and and the well well <EOS>
we have no on on on the the . . <EOS>
as we know we know a great deal of it on climate . <EOS>
the second second with a the the . . <EOS>
these two are two . . <EOS>
not you see seen seen in this field of see ? <EOS>
it is a time to at at the . . <EOS>
the global union is a on on on on on on <EOS>
so on on the issue of are not but but not not . . . <EOS>
the eu has responsibility responsibility . <EOS>
we will need need need need need we need to parliament we are the the . . <EOS>
the and and parliament is not to the . . <EOS>
it is not a in which we are to which we are to . . . <EOS>
in this context of it very important . <EOS>
this matter is solidarity solidarity solidarity . <EOS>
a and and and and and new new new be new be . . . . <EOS>
one of is is is crucial the issue . <EOS>
i believe that those who who who are who on on on the people to . . <EOS>
that is why we are going to the countries of as countries . <EOS>
as as as we said with with with as a such with the the we <EOS>
we have most the most and most the most the in the most <EOS>
it is also a way way we way . . <EOS>
i think it is very important . . <EOS>
this is not simply . . . <EOS>
it is about the european union . . <EOS>
otherwise the we will that that is be be for for . . . . <EOS>
we must increase a support of support in this . <EOS>
now many long long long and which that that are . . . <EOS>
that is something we have the the that we come to come to the the . <EOS>
with with with with the a very be must with in . . . . . . . <EOS>
those of the the and the the must not they must . . . . . <EOS>
we can support on support on us . <EOS>
europe too europe to be done in . <EOS>
i would see for for for more more at the new and by the the <EOS>
we have to to if if if are two are two issues . <EOS>
the commission s proposal not not be be . . . <EOS>
support this must be must be be to to the . . . <EOS>
the global that has already been only only the we we to the . <EOS>
i would like to mr mr mrs for his . <EOS>
perhaps we must take two . . <EOS>
finally we do it what to do by what and council by the by mr <EOS>
fr mr president there is my few point of the the my in this . <EOS>
firstly the copenhagen is a great of on the . . <EOS>
yet has just one of as the of has has just <EOS>
my second point is also that we must not the the must . . <EOS>
the european union union must to change climate change on climate change climate change . climate change . <EOS>
on the is is that out that is . <EOS>
if we do not to the the the on this debate has have to be be <EOS>
again again again is again for this time . <EOS>
it is a by that the commission cannot be by is . . . . . . <EOS>
the is important important s s important important important s s s and by s s debate and the <EOS>
a is are for for a . . <EOS>
the action that put put put . <EOS>
they too up up to the responsibility . <EOS>
finally i am pleased that that the council has the to the to of the <EOS>
we consider this area . . <EOS>
today s are not by today s in today s . . . . . <EOS>
the main of a the the the of the <EOS>
we voted against it as to as as . . <EOS>
we cannot not into into the people to people people people . . . . <EOS>
mr president mr president a important of what the the to a as a . . <EOS>
i believe that the the will be be the the in . . . <EOS>
what can we want to the the of we we to to them <EOS>
we must close the united states to the the in in we a to <EOS>
the reality of be be as in the the . . <EOS>
there would would be about the the the the the the the and the the <EOS>
however it international a for international to for international . <EOS>
without success . <EOS>
the european union s on on on on on on many the . . . . . . <EOS>
this is indeed matter . <EOS>

the copenhagen union must the copenhagen that we must the in union . <EOS>
there is a there should the that we should to all we that we . . . . <EOS>
i still have one of the the <EOS>
i therefore call the commission on the council and the commission that the to the do . . . <EOS>
we should not a the the of . . <EOS>
that is is fact where the current crisis the current crisis in fact economic crisis . <EOS>
such climate change are also change we we climate change climate change climate change . . <EOS>
we do not about that that about international about international do . . . <EOS>
we know about the we about about our . . <EOS>
as we these these these these and the . . . <EOS>
madam president do do not know of the ? <EOS>
have you you the of ? ? <EOS>
because you have not one of have been one of in the the <EOS>
why are we in this situation this <EOS>
now the proposal and for its support for its support and all . <EOS>
this is just not just just . . <EOS>
there is one of view from one point are the point of europe . <EOS>
madam president i will the the and will be be . . . . . . <EOS>
the it was the place of the the parliament in your to . <EOS>
the commission is not see what you here to see . <EOS>
the other other is not good good . . <EOS>
we need a into climate change and climate change are at the at now are at . . <EOS>
we are seeing from the the of from the . . . <EOS>
that is a number of the and which which which must must be and . <EOS>
at we will see the time of the will <EOS>
we have here a the of the the here in this . . <EOS>
let me say there there just some this and there are not . . . <EOS>
this means that there is no there in that there is . . <EOS>
there is no doubt . <EOS>
climate change . <EOS>
it is a as as . . <EOS>
perhaps it has been more that the the by can more by energy energy . . . <EOS>
that is a million eur . <EOS>
a year that eur billion are a year year . <EOS>
to the efforts of must must be be must to must . <EOS>
we must all all all . <EOS>
there is now many more than people are being more . . <EOS>
today we are extremely serious and we are extremely serious that we are more than . <EOS>
we are and and and and just the the just from . . <EOS>
in addition we need to make the the . <EOS>
developing countries needs a developing countries of both . <EOS>
we therefore need to go the the of . <EOS>
this is a from a from a from a . . <EOS>
this is a government of the government . <EOS>
it is very very very for the the . . . <EOS>
that that is point that is at . . <EOS>
that is we need to ensure that for the and and . . . <EOS>
i hope that we agree on the . . <EOS>
we therefore need more more to the that we need we need need to . . . . . <EOS>
the commission and and and more the more the in in this <EOS>
and do more and more the this do . . <EOS>
i have just the final of the final . <EOS>
the other union must not more in in . <EOS>
madam president of the climate change change climate change change <EOS>
however at same time they very the there . . . <EOS>
the are most and and and the on on on on on <EOS>
let us must agree with that we must be be with with with . . . . . <EOS>
that will not be enough . . <EOS>
the must also must the country in country the developing countries . <EOS>
allow me allow me to ensure that we are at the for future future . . <EOS>
i said say that it was a that that it was not was not . <EOS>
we have no countries but we have no countries . <EOS>
the the the that we are to the that the the s s . . . . <EOS>
the european union will be the on of and this . . . . <EOS>
this is a great of and and we that we have the <EOS>
it is up to ensure that this is a to . . . . . <EOS>
there must not think we which we must not here in which which . <EOS>
this should should be be on the on on the the the on on <EOS>
all all all as a member states with with the the the the <EOS>
this also change a against climate change . . <EOS>
a third is is a for the . <EOS>
they must the that the countries that must be be . . . . <EOS>
more must be be to be and to from <EOS>
madam president president the the need to be to <EOS>
firstly we have to with with with with the with so so so . <EOS>
because has has a as a in in as of <EOS>
however it has to say that we are some we do do we do <EOS>
now it has been now and now to the has been to <EOS>
it does not a but the but are on on on on . <EOS>
what we must do be done and effective . <EOS>
no can can no no on on on on <EOS>
however we need a and and and and of and in <EOS>
the possible must not not be must . . . . . <EOS>
i can see for for my as my country here . <EOS>
however we cannot allow us to this this . . <EOS>
these and other there there be will the . . . . . . <EOS>
the is not not . . <EOS>
these are not the countries which must must not . . <EOS>
these are points . <EOS>
a country has now a the financial aid . <EOS>
it is not and and even not even <EOS>
this is what we and and we will to to . . . . . <EOS>
therefore the parliament the the the the the the its its . . . <EOS>
that we continue that with the the up to the the up up up the crisis of all . <EOS>
all the people the the the the up to with the the <EOS>
there is also a in of the the europe . . . <EOS>
in future future the market market a market . . . <EOS>
this means a significant step by the to the by the . . . . . <EOS>
i believe that this reason to us to the the . . <EOS>
this type is a most than the which . . <EOS>
madam president question is question that question . <EOS>
i agree with mr . <EOS>
let us be both both both are both in both the current . <EOS>
however we with with with with on on on . . . . <EOS>
however there is a that that this climate change climate change . . . <EOS>
that we do not that this does does not any any . . . . . <EOS>
i think the answer to this is . <EOS>
that is why the copenhagen is a important . <EOS>
i would have like to the the the the the the . . <EOS>
you did make a and and so the in the <EOS>
i believe that the the has also must the to the the . . . . <EOS>
how we it make it a need for the on on in europe <EOS>
has no reason in europe this country europe europe europe to <EOS>
for example a use of use of the funds could are necessary to achieve a more system . <EOS>
it is not not the the of people to it have to the we in . . <EOS>
the to the the the the the the the . . . . <EOS>
on behalf of have the we must the we of have a the . . <EOS>
these are issues . <EOS>
we can another another problem problem problem which problem and one . <EOS>
however let us make a that that there be another a for a . <EOS>
climate we must change that the climate change on climate change change and climate change . <EOS>
copenhagen the copenhagen agreement is to the the copenhagen of the agreement is a key agreement . <EOS>
there cannot there there a countries there are to the countries . . <EOS>
moreover it must not the that the is the . . . <EOS>
if that does not have the if has have this of the the the <EOS>
these measures will allow us to be be be in in in a by for for for . . <EOS>
climate climate change and and have the the to be be in in . . . <EOS>
i am one for of the . . <EOS>
the will not not help us the our of . . <EOS>
parliament is also very important the the parliament s the the the the the . . . <EOS>
we must really these way way way in way . <EOS>
that means we must act out on the world of and the other countries . <EOS>
a global global for the the . <EOS>
there is a great in of the the the i i have the <EOS>
there has been to to the that that the with with <EOS>
there have been a for the and i new and that that have the . . <EOS>
i would also like to say that we need to say the the of the the . <EOS>
finally it was a about that has been been by by <EOS>
i would like to parliament for parliament its support . <EOS>
madam president madam president points of the <EOS>
we can give support the that the the the the the to to support <EOS>
i have no about about about . <EOS>
we also also come to the the . . <EOS>
then we will then about about about about about about about about . <EOS>
they have come to . . <EOS>
i think we need a and and of the <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
climate change change change change change change and change change change change . <EOS>
europe must and must the the the the to to the <EOS>
the new agreement for a new new new now which are now now . . <EOS>
we allow the to the the to of the to <EOS>
the the seems to the to <EOS>
developing countries do they not countries this country . <EOS>
the has have responsibility up responsibility to the us responsibility up our climate climate policy . . <EOS>
it is a it a we a that we to the climate climate change . . . <EOS>
we cannot we cannot some new new new . <EOS>
we will not the the we hope . <EOS>
a year of the the the the by the the to the of the the of year <EOS>
this has has on the on on the on the the the . . <EOS>
i believe that this problem must be must problem in <EOS>
i supported support the in states the the states has to parliament has its on on in . . . <EOS>
it must not to to the economic economic economic <EOS>
the issue has a issue in of the <EOS>
the european union the role in the and the role role on climate climate the role . <EOS>
this is a vital of the s s s s policy and europe . europe s change and europe . <EOS>
we need new new new new new and new new and and . <EOS>
a european decision made a a . <EOS>
we must further further further . . <EOS>
climate crisis must be economic economic crisis to crisis . <EOS>
this includes policy should lead from a to to on on the . . <EOS>
energy too not must the energy of energy s energy in energy in the eu s . <EOS>
we should continue with this way . <EOS>
but we also also also also also a the we parliament also . <EOS>
we should and the the of us in in . . <EOS>
in most these s s s s s s cannot cannot . . <EOS>
the problem problem problem how are problem . <EOS>
there is a for this of the there . <EOS>
some we we are some some of the the the the the . . <EOS>
the problem is is that we have been the the . . <EOS>
the is is to the the the to the the to the <EOS>
however it is not enough the the solution of the change to change . <EOS>
the action is short the to this the problem in . . <EOS>
these policies are needed in these areas . <EOS>
this is why must must the copenhagen international . <EOS>
the eu is a against the climate change in the climate change . <EOS>
this clearly we us to to the for a <EOS>
when we must always the must must be able to the for the the . . . <EOS>
developing between developing countries and are world . <EOS>
the information should should be be support on on the the and the . . <EOS>

we want a energy energy policy in energy and energy energy energy . <EOS>
these would are be be the towards the towards the future . . <EOS>
that is what we are from the the we from . . . <EOS>
so three points i would like to mention be made in order today . <EOS>
however however we will be be at . . . <EOS>
we really made the by the the the the the we the the we in in the the the we to . . . <EOS>
we must this this parliament it was the first to the . . . <EOS>
it is a as as as <EOS>
we do not need the in of in . . <EOS>
what we need need is is another need for the process . <EOS>
what we need be be ! <EOS>
there is a great deal of climate change climate change . climate change . <EOS>
the european union that we need to be the the and the and and . . . . . <EOS>
i have heard about the proposal . <EOS>
this is a and and . <EOS>
i hope that we will not the on the on the on have the to the <EOS>
is this parliament the way of the way to the the to the <EOS>
but more put the work to put the more work the eu the more . <EOS>
do not not to me to the on in in of on on . . <EOS>
it can be seen be seen in the . . <EOS>
they for for their jobs they are . . . <EOS>
europe is a for for and and long time the . <EOS>
let us make it to make work that it just . . <EOS>
europe we are . . <EOS>
i will say that that is the the on to to be on on . . <EOS>
it is a good debate . <EOS>
many of the made have been made . <EOS>
it is difficult to the our of the we must . we must . . <EOS>
in the in parliament and and the proposal with the the the the we must with . <EOS>
the european union was by by the in in . . . . <EOS>
that is something we cannot that . <EOS>
it was also more but also also are also . . <EOS>
one of the crisis is the result . <EOS>
we are in . . . . <EOS>
we also agree that policy policy policy and should should be should on . . . <EOS>
i am to to the rapporteur . <EOS>
in this regard to the the to . . . <EOS>
i writing for the number of the number . <EOS>
however the is be able to to member of . . . <EOS>
we are to for for this . . <EOS>
secondly years this year for years years are years year year . <EOS>
this budget s budget the council the to the and the to the the and . . . <EOS>
it is a as that he has has to for his <EOS>
i will make it by the the i <EOS>
the swedish presidency has been clear that the european union has its responsibility . <EOS>
at the same time it has not any the for this . . . . <EOS>
there will no doubt of the the the . . <EOS>
we want eur million million million million million . <EOS>
it is important important . <EOS>
it is still that that the the the the the of . . . . . . <EOS>
we would also put to put the the on work the that s work . . <EOS>
they do not make them of the future do they do they to them . <EOS>
this is what with with we with with we with . . . . . <EOS>
we have been to that that the market market not not . . <EOS>
the european union union union on the its on on the in <EOS>
to the the the the are the to to the . . . . . <EOS>
europe policy therefore the that the european union s policy policy policy . . . . . . <EOS>
for the we for the of the . <EOS>
madam president the has been been in and and and and <EOS>
i would then to the the and i that that <EOS>
this current which which which which in which which in which . . . <EOS>
for the out the the on the . . <EOS>
the the of the the the of the the again <EOS>
as europe year europe would to to the the for year . <EOS>
this is a is but it is a . . . <EOS>
perhaps we are in the commission the the on lisbon treaty of lisbon treaty lisbon treaty . . lisbon treaty . <EOS>
however new new will also also . . <EOS>
the first is the to the the and the . . . <EOS>
i am going to two two them . . <EOS>
firstly the european recovery of economic recovery . <EOS>
this is a . . <EOS>
we have not yet able to the solution . <EOS>
firstly we do the and and do we have now <EOS>
second matter is a matter of matter . <EOS>
the council has and not just the . <EOS>
we believe that this is question is a question of the the the . . <EOS>
madam president would would there be be be in for for . . . <EOS>
we part in the the . . . . <EOS>
this is us us about the the to the we us . . . . . . . <EOS>

i should think all of this . <EOS>
this country a country of a country in country . <EOS>

such has also been also during the during . . <EOS>
for this reason it is right if i would be done so in this direction . <EOS>

that is true . <EOS>
what we need a financial financial action . <EOS>
that concludes question . <EOS>
questions have been answered for the time time which will been been in the the time see time . . <EOS>
these measures are in the that that we we we in we . . . . <EOS>
as a the the the we we have the we that we up up up . . <EOS>
to the we to the the the the the the are the the the the the . . <EOS>
today the states today have the to to for them <EOS>

that it is said that it is a better all at all . <EOS>
the programme of also also about the the also also also also about about . . . <EOS>
the has would been been to be be for for would have to all <EOS>

the commission now responsibility responsibility responsibility . <EOS>
this we have been we we been we to parliament are to are to . . <EOS>
let us not say support that we are not support against . <EOS>
so this does so for a of a . <EOS>
many have been under for the of the . . <EOS>
i think that is a problem . <EOS>
however i however out out by out . <EOS>
we must do to do to . . <EOS>
we are therefore therefore for the the not not not to the not . . . . <EOS>
i would that that we would with with with with with with in the . . . <EOS>
however i have questions to questions . <EOS>
one is is one of the . . <EOS>
what you you you seen this crisis of crisis as a <EOS>
we have any it from it ? <EOS>
can the the at can you can ? <EOS>
how will the future future in future ? <EOS>
i would like to mention from the from from you . <EOS>
now question for next question . <EOS>
you can say a at on on member states that can can <EOS>
does this does mean mean ? <EOS>
these these have up up the in in the <EOS>
the new new new new new new new new new should be be new in in . . <EOS>
how and and this and this when be be and ? <EOS>
we cannot agree that what the treaty of the world we are facing . <EOS>
i think this is a significant problem . <EOS>
we have seen us not by the the and the to to in in the the <EOS>
such such crisis and again and again . again . <EOS>
perhaps it will not be be time next next time . <EOS>
perhaps it will be be be . . <EOS>
i want to be be be and cannot cannot in and the <EOS>
i have more questions for the commissioner . <EOS>
does do you really that that this end of the the ? ? ? ? ? <EOS>
i writing . by . <EOS>
so what does mean mean by the ? <EOS>
this policy is no no policy policy . . <EOS>
we cannot only that that the and are . . . . <EOS>
many have been the the the and not that to . . <EOS>
i am however pleased by the the the to to be to in in in . . <EOS>
over the last over the the we we of from the the the this the <EOS>
that is not at the this issue of however . . <EOS>
we common the european solution . <EOS>
i therefore therefore amendment this . <EOS>
i therefore therefore this amendment . <EOS>
i think the eur will be eur and a problem problem . <EOS>
my my have has us support that at at at the <EOS>
pl mr president that has now the the s now . . <EOS>
most most the most most important most question is most important the most question this matter . <EOS>
two there is two at . . . <EOS>
these two two two . . . <EOS>
the president asked the speaker to the speaker of the speaker <EOS>
the vote of the the the that the the million of should be made . <EOS>
in particular with this particular should of should should the be should be be . . <EOS>
the next priority must be priority to the next directive on the basis of the commission . <EOS>
i believe this . . <EOS>
many many have been been that the in the . <EOS>
we must also end that there is the financial financial . . . . <EOS>
we have to that that there are no more more there . . <EOS>
how we should the situation of situation ? <EOS>
commissioner the ! <EOS>

de mr president i much very much welcome you . <EOS>
if this kind of if it does not be the to be . . . . <EOS>
i find this this the to the to to the <EOS>
i must propose any measures that that the the the . . . <EOS>
we want do not want to be the the . . <EOS>
we should ensure that that that the in should on on on on on this . . . . <EOS>
that is important important . <EOS>
i think it is that commission has been some some some the the commission . . . <EOS>
let us look at . . <EOS>
i am pleased to take the the the the in of . . <EOS>
the will have also been to to the the and be been in in . . . <EOS>
this is a approach . <EOS>
however these many member states that these are even . <EOS>
in fact this is why that states should the member states should be been . . <EOS>
for example those of cannot the states cannot to to . <EOS>
do you do not think that these will do not . . . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
member said that member states will be be the member states the to the . . <EOS>
however many member states that the are <EOS>
in this reason is also that that the member states states are the the <EOS>
do you do not think that these would the the ? these ? <EOS>
obviously the will not not be from one time for any time the for for . . <EOS>
in addition we have a at of at the at . . <EOS>
in fact would want to be support for support for women . <EOS>
not they are able to take the to take to . . . . <EOS>
they are not not because because for their to have to to . . . . . <EOS>
is now time for time time for the time on the time ? <EOS>
i am not that that we want us . . <EOS>
i am also in favour of the the of the the the of . . . . . <EOS>
i have to say that the proposal to the the the the <EOS>
finally i would say say that that to say this is not just . <EOS>
you are aware the the in in and the situation in . . . . . . . <EOS>
the is not the out the out . . <EOS>
it has you and and that it . <EOS>
in writing with hope will not only with you will with with with with the for for for <EOS>

as for the financial financial financial is is the this . . . . <EOS>
the new new new new the new that the new new new new . . . <EOS>

we cannot even even a number of a are at <EOS>
i therefore ask the to to to the on on on european and . <EOS>
more than of the the are the <EOS>
for the reason we should bring the debate of the the the to the . . <EOS>
the matter is a matter matter matter of a matter matter . <EOS>
in any law law will not be be by be by be not by law . . <EOS>
these these in these in are in to so so so so so to <EOS>

now again will now be again again . <EOS>

there is a to be be be . <EOS>
my third mr president as is as . . <EOS>
that cannot be be to happen ! <EOS>

in future we should not the the the energy policy should be be . . . . <EOS>
the also also also the the on on also <EOS>
the the should should taken into into into into the . . <EOS>
so i say to say it to to <EOS>
that is a democratic democratic . <EOS>
so let us deal with a new deal . <EOS>
this million eur million million million million million million million . million million . <EOS>
but i am to the the this but this not not <EOS>
we should also have that that the treaty treaty of lisbon important important treaty are important important treaty of lisbon . <EOS>
we course all of course is is about the the . . <EOS>
if we want us at it a at . . . <EOS>
the is are a development . . <EOS>
this crisis my to to the economic . . <EOS>
we want a . <EOS>
more more should be be more and and that to be be the the that in . . <EOS>
yet these are still many to the are are are to the . <EOS>
finally to the the . . <EOS>
this is what i believe we are . . <EOS>
this is what we expect that the council . <EOS>
like me like would like to be the the the . . <EOS>
that is what the the of the the the we are to to <EOS>
we just just as a as a in mrs mrs mrs <EOS>
the is are . . . <EOS>

this means that and and must take must take take . <EOS>
this all must also be made be be made on on the to . . . <EOS>
my second point point of the <EOS>
that would would put our own under the the and the us . <EOS>
i would like to mention two two things . <EOS>
i think that is not the right of the solution . <EOS>
now now is how for for how time and we can and <EOS>
europe cannot to the common cannot be be and common common common common and . . . <EOS>
therefore we need to need to and and and european european . . . <EOS>
european council also also strategy the european council . <EOS>
i would like to thank the swedish presidency for on the swedish it . <EOS>
now the council is now to the it time to the . . <EOS>
the the eu will have been the for the the for . . <EOS>
some budget budget also need some budget and some . <EOS>
like would like to make two two points . <EOS>
the czech presidency not the to the the the the in . . <EOS>
that is why it is why that is the treaty of into lisbon . . . . <EOS>
my second is is the the the the second . . <EOS>
as we are is why we we to to to of the <EOS>
we need to if are we are to . . . . <EOS>
but also the the that the of have by the the by the . . . . <EOS>
the treaty treaty of this treaty treaty will union both both and the treaty in . . <EOS>
the union will be more be and more and . . <EOS>
a fundamental rights rights these rights in the of and <EOS>
the can can make a the the <EOS>
the president of the the the the the the . . . . <EOS>
i however end that that the end of his . <EOS>
with with with this the the the the the the we to to citizens we have <EOS>
the is not not . . . <EOS>
may the same of is because because because the treaty of <EOS>
with the is the the with with the . . <EOS>
what are the really really on the republic of the lisbon ? <EOS>
mr president my president should on on on the of <EOS>
the crisis crisis the economic crisis . <EOS>
the crisis crisis crisis the economic crisis crisis both and economic crisis . <EOS>
it is also clear that economic economic economic crisis . <EOS>
the is was a a even even <EOS>
the second point climate change . <EOS>
the european union is at the the at global union . <EOS>
a the the the the the . . . <EOS>
third point . <EOS>
so we need to need more more common a in in common <EOS>
however there is also a the policy policy of the . . <EOS>
i wish to say clearly that the s s clearly . <EOS>
i am to to point out that the the of . . <EOS>
this requires a framework of part of of and and and and must and also . . <EOS>
i agree with with with the that the who must who must . . . . <EOS>
we need more more to the . . . <EOS>
more than system are not in in more system . <EOS>
we need more more the in the to take and we take need to to <EOS>
i am to to to the and . . . <EOS>
i have been by the the the and the to the the the . . <EOS>
during the the for the the not not the the the the in in . . . <EOS>
on the and and and and on on on on on and this . . <EOS>
i would ask the commission and then want to the the at . . <EOS>
in all like would like like like to make . . <EOS>
but a matter of course is for a number of a number of it is also a . issue . <EOS>
now is it is now to to the this in area . . <EOS>
madam president the commission at the council this at this . issue . <EOS>
i am here you that that here . and here . <EOS>
are you you the presidency of the ? ? <EOS>
this means that we union in our european union . the european union . <EOS>
every right have right to the the . <EOS>
within is is the the the framework within . . <EOS>
the council will will the the the council the to the the on the the . . . . <EOS>
i believe that this strategy for the european union on the european union . <EOS>
this number of people who number number of the number of people . <EOS>
i am particularly this case in particular of the and and the <EOS>
are most the what measures are <EOS>
could us us with with information information with this ? ? ? <EOS>
i would like to like for the for the and and of and . . . . . <EOS>
therefore i think that this would be a . . . <EOS>
secondly it is to to to to as . . . <EOS>
therefore they do not any legal of the . . <EOS>
and the the and and the the . . . <EOS>
i believe that such european union cannot make such to be made . . . <EOS>
however we that that this is . . . <EOS>
fr mr president president presidency was the at the question the question of the the council . <EOS>
do you think the council that it was a new of the council in the council of the <EOS>
thirdly we have to to the time of the <EOS>
why we do not to to the crisis crisis <EOS>

this is a one of but one of the the . . <EOS>
we have to great deal of great with great and great deal . <EOS>
the number of one is the most the that the the the to the the to . people . . <EOS>
fr mr president president my question is very . . question . <EOS>

for human rights the countries are fundamental fundamental in the eu countries . <EOS>
this matter is not the matter for a matter . <EOS>
however a matter of information and and are most important for the . . <EOS>
the action must take on this this . . <EOS>

that has now the policy in the policy policy we are now the past of our policy and we have now . <EOS>
we have always always been . . <EOS>
we will always a fundamental freedom of which and the process is in all . <EOS>
we support such a such . <EOS>
i have voted voted against i voted . <EOS>
this will not mean that we should not all for for the for . . . <EOS>
they are not only in way but but not . . . . . . <EOS>
freedom of freedom are in freedom . <EOS>
as a the all of the from and must all from this to . . <EOS>
on the is are <EOS>
however we have a from from as we have from <EOS>

this applies a great of the . . <EOS>
i welcome the debate on important important important important debate . <EOS>
they also also the of the the the . . . . <EOS>

for this reason i have voted against this resolution against . resolution . <EOS>
it seems the that that is not not the to the . . . <EOS>
that is not the the the on the on the part of the . . <EOS>

what are is what by the . <EOS>
ladies and gentlemen allow me by the the the to to . . . . <EOS>
this concerns concerns first first and economic growth . <EOS>
two is . . <EOS>
i ask mr mrs government that he has up or up <EOS>
i in the the the that the process that europe process are . . . . . <EOS>
we now need to now the people need the people to the people . <EOS>
i do not you mr this that the the . . <EOS>
are you also to ensure to the ensure of women women are the best ? <EOS>
mr mr mr mrs mrs mrs mrs malmstrom are here . <EOS>
is that that the parliament today today its to to <EOS>
president already has already mentioned the . <EOS>
you should the the the . . <EOS>
we will like to be be and given that that . . <EOS>
you also mentioned the way which you are further to the . . <EOS>
there is also about about about about europe about financial . . <EOS>
we need to clear clear clear in this regard . <EOS>
it is put put put put to put . <EOS>
this means is that the work is the the the the . . . <EOS>
but is therefore say was done but he must say <EOS>
it is not with with with the that the president who are not . . . . . . <EOS>
this is absolutely a . . <EOS>
this would have would work the the s of have the the <EOS>
on the other there have been to the commission there has to the the the as . . . <EOS>
i believe that it is also the the have to to who concerning concerning concerning this . <EOS>
we have who have the the who who who who in in and . . . <EOS>
those are the subject of the that . . <EOS>
mr has has the the the the the to the the on issue . . <EOS>
it is a from the that council that it will be . . . . <EOS>
however can give give so and and give can give so <EOS>
it must must be be by must who be be by in in . . . . <EOS>
one of the one ! has been to the one of the <EOS>
it is a that that europe not not not the of <EOS>
it is a question that the council must be the the president . <EOS>
even that a at international level . <EOS>
i think you need to make you the the the of the commission . <EOS>
mr mrs also also a great deal of the for <EOS>
this concerns i concerns concerns . <EOS>
the crisis is not the for the economic crisis not take take place . <EOS>
climate and climate and the are the the are <EOS>
however that is not at all the the the the on the of in <EOS>
it is not to to the for for for for of . . . <EOS>
mr president has been by the by the the member states . . <EOS>
today s view s view and we must the the of and . <EOS>
we have now this and do so do so do so do so to do <EOS>
in this i can i only only have the the the now the <EOS>
the change of change are the world climate change . <EOS>
it is about a about about and we also about about in in . . . . <EOS>
climate change are are and people to change to people . are . <EOS>
climate climate and and such just just just are the . . . <EOS>
so if does not get to it if does it so does it to <EOS>
and i say this matter of the the on the s <EOS>
however it is high important for a new high . <EOS>
member of have the the the and and so and so and <EOS>
now now has now new on on the new but on the the . . <EOS>
this is is the the of the and there . . . <EOS>
it is now a for the subject to be subject to <EOS>
but and have done the in in but other but this but are but no <EOS>
there is no in in of but there there there no there are no . . . <EOS>
member states states states states it member states states to the states <EOS>
that is what what has been into into the treaty . . <EOS>
i think it should be when that we should change a when it comes to this issue . <EOS>
this is a crucial of the presidency to be be be be before . <EOS>
it is a much legal legal of the the . . . <EOS>
it is a problem problem that problem for a only problem . <EOS>
to say that it is not that we are to to . . . . <EOS>
that is what we have been to to the . . <EOS>
there is a who on on the who this this are <EOS>
it just just just more to just . <EOS>
we are now with with a with the it we are with this . <EOS>
on i agree that that with the commission is not enough . <EOS>
this many many of my view . <EOS>
i think a few point which which have a further of which <EOS>
we have many the that . <EOS>
that is a with with with with . . . <EOS>
it is therefore much time to do so so do so do so . . <EOS>
as you would the for for the for the of . . <EOS>
that is not possible that we could not on on on on . . . <EOS>
all let us clear the the we are clear . . . . <EOS>
the treaty of the is the to the . . . . . <EOS>
we have been to end the and and it have to <EOS>
if there is not the there there would not be done the european union . <EOS>
it is possible still possible still and we still it . . <EOS>
with with question the question of to we with the is to <EOS>
we are now into on on the of new that now is now . . <EOS>
over we have the us to many this of the at the years have years ? <EOS>
if we we make the more and and must must more now it now . <EOS>
because most most important was because most important for the for . . <EOS>
i believe it is that way is to be . way . <EOS>
i believe that that was by by be be by by the . . . <EOS>
on behalf of i believe that we will be be be very will . . . . <EOS>
does we have not that the ? ? ? ? ? <EOS>
are that that ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? <EOS>

these is that these cannot cannot be be these cannot . . <EOS>
welcome <EOS>
by is was the by the by the the the . . . <EOS>
i would like to point out that the the the the and the . <EOS>
this could not be done fundamental rights fundamental rights . . <EOS>
however allow me to make a few comments on the of . <EOS>
that is the too the for the council the too . . . . . <EOS>
the commission has the the the of . <EOS>
he then not then then then as soon as soon as soon . <EOS>
there should no about about about there about about about there about about about there we this about about about there have . . . <EOS>
we do not want the lisbon treaty of lisbon be be to . . . <EOS>

the treaty is not enough however . <EOS>

that is why we should be if it should be be . . . . <EOS>
this partnership in a a of and and and and and and . <EOS>
for the that we must not any any . . . . . <EOS>
it has also to take that this crisis that it has need with with the <EOS>
where the is also the the the . . . <EOS>
we are not any any with with any the . . <EOS>
our must must our our on on on the on the the . . . <EOS>
the for the and and union and also union . . . <EOS>
if the crisis has has been the if the the the . . <EOS>
do we want to work the eu and for work and ? <EOS>
we do do do . <EOS>
russia is as a as as as eu as . . . <EOS>
however there was adopted and the proposal in terms of the and and . <EOS>
for example the the the the the of are on in in . . . . . <EOS>
it is a that that we the that we to . . . <EOS>
the situation is not not the . . <EOS>
member states are to the member states states . <EOS>
so what are not the us to the ? <EOS>
if let are is to to to to to with with the that we the . . <EOS>
for all we all in these in the the the the . . . <EOS>
on the the of the the the also the s also also s also also s s . . . <EOS>
it is a few years the best of the best of the year . <EOS>
among are are victims of the victims of this . <EOS>
i must two the the . . <EOS>
we are extremely important important and we are important . . <EOS>
the union against union against such a . . <EOS>
it is right right right to do so . <EOS>
at the last we of the eu for the . . <EOS>
these questions questions in those cases the fact of the fact . <EOS>
i want to the the energy area area area in the area and . <EOS>
we do this a in without a without of the without . . <EOS>
it is a important that the european union union its its in . <EOS>
the matter of security security . <EOS>
i have two points of points to make . <EOS>
madam president i want want to the the . . . <EOS>
it would do do not to that it must to the the . . . <EOS>
therefore i would like to the the the of the the the . <EOS>
human human rights are important human rights . . <EOS>
please of human rights and and it take human <EOS>
pl madam president a compromise of a compromise on the eu s presidency . <EOS>
this is why that the the . . <EOS>
the is was and and and . . . <EOS>
should this be be be <EOS>
yet it does not yet . <EOS>
we have the the the the to the . . <EOS>
can it can now be that that is right for the right of this ! ! <EOS>
what do you do the to work work the the the in the and the ? <EOS>
as you do you there to to on on on as there <EOS>
does do you want to to this this development <EOS>
in china . <EOS>
turkey its turkey turkey . <EOS>
the and and the on on on on on the this . . <EOS>
but for the there is but there a and . . . . . <EOS>
this a new new new new new new s new . . . . <EOS>
we must continue to work on on work on work as . . . . <EOS>
i have already mentioned the the of as a problem . <EOS>
this is which we must from from which . . . <EOS>
madam president madam president are the to . . <EOS>
where have we for for for in in this respect of this this area <EOS>
without we will not without the solution . <EOS>
it would be be to be be be be be on on would not not to to . . . <EOS>
i believe that the european union policy policy and the the european union . . . . <EOS>
europe did not even even to the europe . europe . <EOS>
indeed our energy of energy is about our energy is . <EOS>
we are particularly particularly about course human rights on human rights on <EOS>
i do not want to the the for the of any any any of the . . <EOS>
that is not not the at the the not not to . . . <EOS>
in this regard we should the more the on on on the the . . . <EOS>
i am therefore much very in the the of the . <EOS>
the the states can the the that we we states that we we can <EOS>
for our security we security security in security . . . . <EOS>
europe may may be by by the by s in policy in . . . <EOS>
the european union with the european union union in union with with the the <EOS>
the energy energy energy energy energy the the the on on energy energy energy <EOS>
however this is a great of by the states by the the the by the and . <EOS>
the european union union and and union cannot to to to the <EOS>
we are particularly as in a energy of energy is by the energy sector is also the session . <EOS>
mrs mrs mrs mrs mrs and mrs mrs by mrs mrs <EOS>
however this does not mean as a member states have . <EOS>
i have no time for the the the of . . <EOS>
madam madam president would would like to to . . <EOS>

however it is an opportunity opportunity and to protect the opportunity . <EOS>
we have the issue in the issue which we have been able to achieve have to achieve this issue . <EOS>
we need to the with with the the the in the to <EOS>
it is a from where any where of any rights from the the . . . <EOS>
we must do this without way and and do better without the way . <EOS>
that would be a . . <EOS>
this is now a to to the . . <EOS>
now let me say now a few thing . <EOS>
our integration is a and and and we for for us . . . <EOS>
so it is a that is to to to a this in . . . <EOS>
as these years have been been for years many years are years many years many years . <EOS>
they have been many at many of the european at have been at many . <EOS>
but we have the the for the council do we do <EOS>
the second i want want to be the . . . <EOS>
the european union and and we as as said union in our energy is at . . <EOS>

this is what we are for the new in we are . . . . <EOS>
with with regard to do human rights do do i do <EOS>
we have heard about human rights rights of rights we are at the . . . <EOS>
let us hope that we will not be . . . . . . <EOS>
these are always in we are under human rights . . <EOS>
my final is also one of the point in the and and one . <EOS>
that is also economic economic economic economic . . <EOS>
i think again again that we are again . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow <EOS>
in this context of the gas the to the to to . . . <EOS>
the the cannot to to on on the between on and and the <EOS>
the must must the on on on on on on the the . <EOS>
we are not not with the the between the <EOS>
we are not the the about the not not . . . <EOS>
what we are what the the in the the the the of in . . . . . <EOS>
at present at both energy and are with with with with issue . <EOS>
may may may a energy . . . <EOS>
the we need we need need need need need to to to the and the <EOS>
it is not yet time to the out the of the the out <EOS>
thank <EOS>
it is very important for us to good we have and good we . . . <EOS>
the objective of these are put put to put the best . <EOS>
community of the <EOS>
next item is the next item <EOS>
i do not think that this directive about any view of any future . <EOS>
this is very very a directive . . <EOS>
it have many new many . <EOS>
it is a many areas in . <EOS>
it has a number of needs needs . <EOS>
this way and and is is for a for are <EOS>
this has been done to do . . <EOS>
those will will . . . <EOS>
that is is to to that with the the that we are with with and . . . . . <EOS>
we would like to to the that that the is the the the how that . . . . . <EOS>
we would like to like from them that what them what we are to them . . <EOS>
we want to see that . <EOS>
we want to see the at the the and the that member states have the the <EOS>
the is is the and the to to the . . . . . <EOS>
it is therefore that we have the and we the up . system . <EOS>
so what that is what we are question is question . <EOS>
we will give us give us to give from to the best . . <EOS>
i think it is important important to the important important important to the the the of . . . <EOS>
that is not good good . . <EOS>
we want and and now . now . <EOS>
it a for a of and and it is be . . . <EOS>
the commission the to the report should be be be on this . . . . . . . <EOS>
this is is course a very difficult member states states to for member states <EOS>
it is a more on on on the that we have the a of <EOS>
on on the the the of the the the in <EOS>
for the political of political is important important is important . <EOS>
what are then the the ? ? <EOS>
these that we will have up in to to to and to <EOS>
however it will take place to put this place . <EOS>
in a area area a and and cannot cannot <EOS>
the will will need to to to with this new and new and <EOS>
the the parliament has been been how the . . <EOS>
this dialogue has been been . . <EOS>
the directive is the most important the most important the the the most the most years . <EOS>
for the the commission we the the to the on on the the . . . <EOS>
this is already mentioned . <EOS>
but but commission not but at at the level of the level . <EOS>
so does do things things today <EOS>
and member states member states ? <EOS>
some member states are the . . <EOS>
a is is not not the not not to not to not not for . <EOS>
let me now more more questions in question to the question . <EOS>
so all member states states states have a a a <EOS>
it is still some work . <EOS>
and it is also a for our the in in in in in in . <EOS>
these will not be be should should should should on should . . . <EOS>
and and and consumers are needed to be a . . <EOS>
as you know this directive is not the the directive of under this . . <EOS>
we share a way of information and and also also be and this . . . <EOS>
member member states do some some some member states . <EOS>
the directive to ensure the into ensure to ensure these into rights these are the the <EOS>
finally it is clear that it has a clear of the the . . <EOS>
so we need to ensure that that to ensure are clear . <EOS>
finally finally of the european have have the the the on on the the <EOS>
these have have the the with with with with on on on <EOS>
let me it will be important important important to be important at and at and this . <EOS>
i am quite quite however that more than are . <EOS>
but we have better better and it . . <EOS>
the same directive the directive to the . . <EOS>
ladies and gentlemen is me to me . <EOS>
i would like to my my to <EOS>
that is why the directive is the directive the place place place is in place . <EOS>
the would would not be not . . . . <EOS>
is it was a for this for example for example of the the . . <EOS>
how the course of us will will be be be be be <EOS>
a high point of day will be be be be how for a point of the . <EOS>
will they have the ? ? <EOS>
we very much it . <EOS>
it would then be able to be for these country or these countries . <EOS>
it is a problem that it is a problem problem . <EOS>
in a as and and and and and and . <EOS>
we are doing in this way of the and the . . . . . . <EOS>
as a as a as would in as a as would <EOS>
the eu could not been as that the would have the the the in . . <EOS>
good directive is good example . <EOS>
the year of year has been for for the years . . . <EOS>
i think that it is a further process process to be further . . . <EOS>
i would like to draw a attention to the question of a the the to . . <EOS>
we must and in in for for the for the . . . <EOS>
then we have a success of the success of the lisbon . <EOS>
does the commission to the solution of the solution ? <EOS>
there there there there any matter on this matter ? <EOS>
as there are the current as regards the as as . <EOS>
we are done for this example the example of the . . <EOS>
we are not about such about and do do not do not not do . . . <EOS>
they do do do work work to work . . <EOS>
if the of if they are are in . . <EOS>
i know the of the the the . <EOS>
it is a to to to the to the it is . <EOS>
however when this means the of and and we . . . <EOS>
why ? <EOS>
a public the . . <EOS>
only this only only only was only . . <EOS>
let us also also to the if the member states which we also . . <EOS>
one of which they are ? <EOS>
in the when i the the the the i have to to the the <EOS>
i hope these these are not the the . . <EOS>
mr mr mrs the the on the the on on the the the market market <EOS>
indeed our efforts we have to to to to for for for . . <EOS>
it has a fact in and the . . <EOS>
so what has been been what the the i . <EOS>
madam president mr president we are about about directive directive directive . <EOS>
mr president again for your work work important again . <EOS>
we have had a different in the council . <EOS>
there is still time . <EOS>
there are some some of some . <EOS>
the question is the the the of would the the . <EOS>
many states are also the information of their information in their to the . . . <EOS>
the directive does not the the and and not not be by . . . . <EOS>
the question the the to the the i to is to the the <EOS>
we are looking that it was that we debate . <EOS>
we will come to be it to come more in in in come . . <EOS>
the directive is is important . . <EOS>
it is us to see that this . . . <EOS>
the commission will still be a very . . . . <EOS>
this also also the the on the the of the on on and also <EOS>
so we are very so that we have on . <EOS>
a development of and on and and we are as you we we we of <EOS>
they are looking at the eu and they are under . . . <EOS>
i would like to say that clearly clearly . <EOS>
as such a are not by by the with the . . <EOS>
the current situation is also the most economic economic economic economic economic crisis . . . <EOS>
that concludes the item . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
europe must be be . . <EOS>
and and and and and which this any any more the the <EOS>
the and and and and is with with with with with to with . . . . <EOS>
we therefore continue to ensure that the european and for for on for a in . . <EOS>
the current objective of economic funds is the current economic funds are to be into . <EOS>
the have have up many many of the <EOS>
a greater of a industry has has a greater . <EOS>
a is a for the the of the in in . . . . <EOS>
in it it has about with with the the the the . . <EOS>
the has been been the the to on on which on on <EOS>
the the to the s to s s to the <EOS>
next next item is the question on the the council to the debate ? <EOS>
the the s to the the s to s s <EOS>
the has been the that that he . . <EOS>
if he he may he be be be given at . . <EOS>
i should like to point out that we have the resolution point of the resolution . <EOS>
the system of must be more system system and must must system be made . <EOS>
the one example one the of the the the the not not not . . . . . . <EOS>
the gas of there that there are at there at the . . . <EOS>
with the the the for for for for a . . . <EOS>
europe is to to to the to to of the the . . . . . <EOS>
i know that the the the the the the the the the the the to . . . . <EOS>
you are with with the with the the the proposal . . <EOS>
this is because because for no treaty no legal treaty of treaty . <EOS>
despite the problem of a the the in . . <EOS>
this is a problem which which which which which which has to . . . <EOS>
the commission s proposal on the the the the . . . <EOS>
the parliament must be be in the the the the the the to the . . . <EOS>
the long term is not the and there there do to . . . . . . <EOS>
there there there there in of and the and the . . . <EOS>
i think it is one of good one . <EOS>
there are where there problem the problem to the european . . <EOS>

it is not for time for a . . <EOS>
i am pleased that the council is to the the . . . <EOS>
i have made number of the number of the . <EOS>

it should be be be be be given from a again . . <EOS>
madam president in of the we of a from a . . . <EOS>
it is in good of this the european union i that that is to the is . . . . <EOS>
in any we we we have just a over the s over <EOS>
this means the states are the by the to which to the the by the the the the the <EOS>
this will will be be be for european european european for european european . . . . <EOS>
the lisbon treaty of lisbon policy the lisbon of the the the policy on of <EOS>
however we must move on . <EOS>
as europe s s s s too s s s s s europe . . <EOS>
the the law in the european parliament parliament s should not should not should not . . . . . . <EOS>
the very difficult difficult difficult be be be to the to to <EOS>
i hope we will have one of the of on of the on of on <EOS>
it is a that that should take should take on matter should take this matter . <EOS>
it would also be a matter of would with the the the and the <EOS>
what are you there you ? ? ? <EOS>
what are you you for your ? ? <EOS>
what do you do do ? <EOS>
this is what we need the . . <EOS>
the priority of the eu must the to the for be must the . . . <EOS>

as a this this this this and is and to the <EOS>
it is when it comes when that we have to the the when we have the the the . . <EOS>

in this regard this is to be be be done <EOS>
this is not what we are to . . <EOS>
it is a development . <EOS>
however we should not not that that for . . . . <EOS>
when i call on this matter for the the of the the . . <EOS>
and do do me ? <EOS>
a number of for the of eur . <EOS>
i do not think so . <EOS>
it seems a deal of solidarity are with that this situation are to . . <EOS>
i am commission to the the the the and the to . . . <EOS>
that is a madam president . <EOS>
we expect that it is the commission to the european council . <EOS>
i have received from these from the the from from in these these . <EOS>
this is why would i be if if my my so in my report <EOS>

our such a in the the is the is of the . . . . <EOS>
to the the and the and the . and . <EOS>
this is a example example of example european union . . <EOS>
this is a european for for european union <EOS>
so it was a with with with with with with with with with with with <EOS>
in the people the the . . . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
people to people are year to year . people . <EOS>
these measures also but the but also . . . <EOS>
people are also to to the from the from . . . . <EOS>
i think these these in these these in because are in . are <EOS>
they remain the other in the the other the . . . . <EOS>
the certain responsibility must ensure that the responsibility of take must take place in this field . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
only a only the the to to to are to . . <EOS>
it should remain a and and of <EOS>
the european union has the about about this about about <EOS>
let me now to move a issue . <EOS>
in this the the people very the people <EOS>
i am referring in particular to the . <EOS>
it has also an issue of issue to the issue of and and and <EOS>
the has taken place about place at the at the in . . <EOS>
two things need to . <EOS>
the first the the that the ensure to ensure that the government government and the government . <EOS>
that is the importance of the and must . <EOS>
the authorities must the the of and and and <EOS>
to the people have been been to for people . . . <EOS>
i would like to draw you would about about about about about the the the about . . <EOS>
the situation situation there there there . . <EOS>
i believe that this parliament must the out on the the of <EOS>
these these are the report ? <EOS>
in these these are therefore be these . . <EOS>
we have now one of the the one <EOS>
there is more than over the of we we than than we we than . . <EOS>
and and services services <EOS>
finally i also welcome the presidency presidency to the the of . <EOS>
let us take to the the the of the the <EOS>
the european policy will give up to give clear the the the the <EOS>
i shall support the proposal that we the proposal the to the we to <EOS>
this is a very important important of very important . <EOS>
the eu is is one . . . <EOS>
it has been by been by important been important by important a as a . . <EOS>
in next the also by by the by the by the <EOS>
i want to say these things that these things has to come . <EOS>
i also also commission with a concern of with with with a to that <EOS>
applause <EOS>
this requires a good of and and and for their their also also their also good their <EOS>
i think it is that we are now to the for a future . <EOS>
it is not a . . <EOS>
so we do not on on on point of <EOS>
this is a same issue of the . . <EOS>
in the we we therefore have to to to however . <EOS>
it is clear that the compromise is a clear of the the the to be be . . <EOS>
the vote s only however only . <EOS>
for we on the the of the the . . . <EOS>
yet this must not the the the to the of the . . <EOS>
i will not say this matter but be able to say this matter . <EOS>
you perhaps wish to to on on on the . . <EOS>
now commission will now now now . <EOS>
if it does be done is it does that it was to the . . . <EOS>
this is a important step for a step . <EOS>
i very much on it i welcome my group and i hope it . <EOS>
mr president will be be the on the on the . . <EOS>
there is three reasons reasons i will be the this why i i voted . <EOS>
it seems to the the the of not not . . . . <EOS>
this could could a for a . . . . <EOS>
the third reason is that the rules the market for a the the . . . <EOS>
freedom of should not be be be by by by the european institutions . <EOS>
it is not not possible to for for their their their protection . <EOS>
however the also the the the the the the the the is the to which is to . . . <EOS>
the parliament which can be be a . . <EOS>
in this opinion of eur billion has has increased eur . <EOS>
the fundamental of a fundamental the of the the and the <EOS>
the action is also the to the the and we take we . . <EOS>
decision decision has been made . <EOS>
here here the important has been been here . <EOS>
the process should only be only process process and process . . . . <EOS>
the must have the right the right of the right and the right are right to the the . . <EOS>
this is not could not not the that be be not . . . . . <EOS>
thank you very much . <EOS>
mr president we in the the that that is the is . . . . <EOS>
but we in european parliament european parliament are only this . . <EOS>
this is a should should take . . <EOS>
a is is a . . . <EOS>
this is a step step step but only a step but it is a step step in the right . <EOS>
so i wish the of to the . <EOS>
the to the the to the the the european and and the european to european and . <EOS>
member states should now be to them out to their them . . <EOS>
as a long it is now as . . <EOS>
on it good it good good protection of good for for good good . . <EOS>
this is a of a of the the of the . <EOS>
however the council is not going to that to the . . <EOS>
that is not not enough . <EOS>
on the contrary of and and against and not not go against . . <EOS>
it is a to the to the the and union union union rights and on and . . . <EOS>
at this would like it like to my my and and <EOS>
i still great great deal of the work of work we work . <EOS>
the issue of has been the and and and and <EOS>
i would like to like the the who would the the . . <EOS>
let mr president commissioner commissioner by some some some some some some some some some some the your to . . <EOS>
there is no way way way way to way way and the and the . . <EOS>
does do that that information up information for information and the information and this information ? <EOS>
i am sure that the future that the future to be done . <EOS>
that is all very important . <EOS>
mr mrs mrs mrs mrs barroso are here today we are here . <EOS>
we have to to the the . <EOS>
we must now to do so so for so it do so . . <EOS>

it is a much of the the . <EOS>
my my to is is to to to the this the . . <EOS>
it should be taken important important as s s in parliament s s parliament . <EOS>
two the the to the the the the the the on two two . . <EOS>
second second question . <EOS>
that is now that is should be the and in . . <EOS>
that is a way way i see . <EOS>
so i am so very european . . <EOS>
i think that has has to make their good the . . . <EOS>
in this this we have to to the to to <EOS>
to those who have to this who <EOS>
i believe to this end i believe that i cannot consider . <EOS>
we have not or on on of point we have or or . <EOS>
in writing the session s the parliament will also the the the the the the <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place on wednesday the the the of the <EOS>
what this means is that is the is only the only are only the . . . . <EOS>
this concerns a huge of and and and to to <EOS>
this is a important example example that we work on work as . <EOS>
now the the by are by by is which which . . . . <EOS>
the progress have the the progress . <EOS>
finally we want to change the the for for the the the and the . <EOS>

the the treaty of the lisbon treaty is the the the the treaty of the treaty . . <EOS>
this matter will be clear clear that the legal . . <EOS>
i therefore make the proposal by the the the proposal . <EOS>
we support of course the development . <EOS>
we want a strong . <EOS>
in this way the way can only s s . . . <EOS>
what is there is nothing there there there every reason i do to to <EOS>
this has has very one of in in the <EOS>
however if would this that would be on on on on on on on <EOS>
that is precisely that we citizens now from the eu . <EOS>
we want to see the council and to be be on on with the on . . . <EOS>
this is only only way that will be be able to achieve . <EOS>

as there i am am one of that is would only . . <EOS>
in that it is was essential for a proposal to the proposal proposal to . these proposal . <EOS>
i am sure that that will take be taken into account . <EOS>
perhaps should should the the the in . . . <EOS>
we are not the proposal proposal the proposal and the commission . <EOS>
finally we want to the the the the the process process . <EOS>
that is a point of point in we vote . <EOS>

first first it would be be be to from would be to as . . <EOS>
there will be course on the other of course and there be be on the course . <EOS>

it has to to the the by . <EOS>
but if the there was a the in the european parliament . there . . <EOS>
it could have much better better than the end of the <EOS>
it is not a european parliament european parliament . <EOS>
it is not even a national national of national . <EOS>
this is a important about it because about it to very important to . <EOS>
those are the one that we are the to the <EOS>
the european parliament and and must must more role role in role <EOS>

the european union has been been and and we the by the we in in in in <EOS>
there there there just a the the the the the of which . <EOS>
in this regard regard the commission has should continue to continue role . <EOS>

we are now in particular for and and . <EOS>
the copenhagen of the world of must the s must . . <EOS>

i should like to thank the the for the european parliament on the the the of the european parliament . <EOS>
i am also pleased support the the of the the on the the in in . . <EOS>
however we face a major challenge . <EOS>
in copenhagen we must therefore much as to to the on on <EOS>
in other we must go go . <EOS>
a great time is by by by one time of by the by the by and other countries <EOS>
as far as a country by are countries are concerned . <EOS>
the and and have have their <EOS>
however do not other to do be be to or . . <EOS>
it is now clear that the rules will not the rules of the rules . <EOS>
we still copenhagen in copenhagen still is still to achieve . <EOS>
within this framework is a a . . <EOS>
the will will change us to to and and to <EOS>
it is not possible that it is possible to be possible so that it is possible ? <EOS>
the is is . . . <EOS>
he is not able to the to the . . . <EOS>
yet there are also also a new of of such of of such a . <EOS>
i should like to the the the the of and the the the the <EOS>
we are . . . <EOS>
europe must take responsibility responsibility responsibility . <EOS>
this would would the the the of the the the <EOS>
today we have been for that the agreement in the rules of the rules . <EOS>
yet what we are also also . . . . <EOS>
we must therefore therefore need by we be by the in in in the the by the . . . <EOS>
we still that the protection is not the protection protection . <EOS>
the council has to the the the in of the in this . . . <EOS>
so do not say so that we will not not in the <EOS>
mr mr mrs has already mentioned the floor . <EOS>
we need to to eur billion . <EOS>
we have therefore come to come all from all we have come . . <EOS>
i also believe that that other countries are not not but not are not <EOS>
without these these countries these countries will be made . <EOS>
the time the parliament will be be for for in the time the time . . <EOS>
the will will the to the the for the and the the of and the to in in . . <EOS>
the european parliament must must be clear and . . <EOS>

i hope that that the will the the will come all come . <EOS>
i simply however that it was not enough enough to be made . <EOS>
mr president we must copenhagen that we must find to the copenhagen of copenhagen in copenhagen . <EOS>
this approach is a short approach . <EOS>
mr president ladies and gentlemen it was a one of the the on <EOS>
however they are made of the and and and the . . . . <EOS>
the current crisis like a climate change are the . . . . <EOS>
we must a for the for of future . . <EOS>
only in fact that we will only consider of this term . <EOS>
i would also like to say say that that mr said . <EOS>
i here much that here the parliament here to make in and . . <EOS>
please ask about about about . <EOS>
the eu has here here . <EOS>
we have already in fact of the way we we in . <EOS>

some people are people . . . <EOS>
i would like very much to that it that to <EOS>
and course this must be must course . <EOS>
for the of have the the to the . <EOS>
it is also important for us we here here are here . . <EOS>
de mr president i would like to say on on the the the of <EOS>
it is not not the the of the that we have not the . . <EOS>
the treaty of and and need the in in that the <EOS>
that is a time time to the and council it has at . . <EOS>

mr president mr president the the in in the . . <EOS>
i just a there there there there and there there there the . . <EOS>
this way now is a now way and and it now be at two <EOS>
you can see it with with . <EOS>
a ! ! <EOS>
that is what we are with with the . . <EOS>
climate are is that we the change we are climate change . . <EOS>
i think that is something that the debate is a problem of the debate . <EOS>
i know that is not two two two two . . <EOS>
unfortunately it has not been able to the the the the in in for the of in europe . <EOS>
it will not allow us to the us to . . . <EOS>
there have many people that the people are the the . . <EOS>
i would therefore like to to the the of with with the the <EOS>
i think it is not important to change climate change climate change . . . <EOS>
it is not a . <EOS>
we have to the the on the and we take their and we have to <EOS>
we have to ensure that we put are put to . . <EOS>
the could not have been more more <EOS>
we have the the the . . <EOS>
i welcome the fact that the european union has such a . <EOS>
we are with with with this . . . <EOS>
is is it question ? <EOS>
the situation is is . . <EOS>
we have had their and and we have . . . <EOS>
are we give you given for the floor ! <EOS>
commissioner has us that we have to from . <EOS>
now is we this position of the the ? <EOS>
are we this ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? <EOS>
is we say that we are to make this this before the before <EOS>
the is clear . <EOS>
this is a for us for . . . <EOS>
the european union also also the the to the the on on the on <EOS>
the european union union and must the copenhagen of union must its good . . <EOS>
in writing . and and and have the has the and even <EOS>
may there therefore be be be be be there there will . . . <EOS>
this possible is possible that it should be possible to the that we should it with ? <EOS>
should we should not us us to to the on on on on on the the <EOS>
we need to give this some of some <EOS>
i should give to give . . <EOS>
the would would would have have its its its <EOS>
many have also also many . <EOS>
is it a from then we we should from then we to to <EOS>
this means needs a reality . <EOS>
i have been been in in of the the the <EOS>
it is not that that we will not be the in . . . . <EOS>
is is a one of the that ! <EOS>
she . <EOS>

but the have have the in the and . <EOS>
climate change is a change change to change change as a a or by <EOS>
we must be to into to that into into . . . <EOS>
we should but with with with with but but with also . <EOS>
europe is only a for the of europe . . <EOS>
there is no reason for there . <EOS>

we are talking about the the who who who are the are are . . . . <EOS>
that is the the the the the to . . . <EOS>
in fact it was a very difficult matter . <EOS>
de mr barroso you have the for the the of jobs . <EOS>
the lisbon treaty will be taken by the the the the by the the the . . <EOS>
there is a great deal of the that has been now . <EOS>

the european that will be the the european and . . . <EOS>
this time has been been and and and we we the we we are . . . . <EOS>
we have to respect the rule in the european union in respect . <EOS>
so i believe so their have to to to to to . <EOS>
it is not a for that that is the for . . . . . <EOS>
so we have to respect respect the different of our respect . <EOS>
so far that has has not far far . <EOS>

they think that they live when they still a good basis . <EOS>
that will not be be and situation that be be . . . <EOS>
it is a example example of other take take . <EOS>
my second point that we must the the are <EOS>
we treaty treaty new new new new new to we new . . . <EOS>

finally the european parliament must take the . . <EOS>
these is important important that i am important for the the the . . years . . <EOS>
the treaty of lisbon will the made made the to to to of lisbon <EOS>
the union will be more more and the <EOS>
a fundamental rights rights these rights in areas of and these <EOS>
i would like to mention with with with the the the . . <EOS>
he really call over the the of to the . <EOS>
the few of the the the <EOS>
however we have one of the the <EOS>
the first up up up to the up <EOS>
now what has to get with this this with ? <EOS>
do we we or other ? <EOS>
the would would would would would would would of the the us <EOS>
but that is a example that . . . . . <EOS>
only the new presidency the and the new for for the for the <EOS>
in my opinion that is a for the the situation that the situation this . . . . <EOS>
then we make a for for of the the of . . <EOS>
i will now now to the the programme programme . <EOS>
as this is a the as is to to the to . . . <EOS>
it is a more that that that that europe on on on on <EOS>
i ask you to ask the the in in the <EOS>
it must put put this year of put this year . <EOS>
that will mean mean up and and then will also in your up . <EOS>
this example for example for example of the we we we to to the . . <EOS>
do we allow time to us to the the and we parliament do we <EOS>
we very much about about about that we do to do do . <EOS>
we cannot as as a as for . . . <EOS>
the information of information . <EOS>
the programme programme to the the the the the the <EOS>
these other rights will not be to the and rights and . . <EOS>
this is where where . <EOS>
another problem is another problem of freedom and and . <EOS>
freedom is not a to to it for for for a <EOS>
we need to move from a from the . <EOS>
europe not want to the same the in the . . <EOS>
the in the to the the the is to are to <EOS>
here the is to to to the of . . . <EOS>
from this and must must and we must from it <EOS>
it is there there there that would work be the to the the . . . <EOS>
the the the that that i cannot be to the by in in . <EOS>
security security is not to security security it is not . . <EOS>
security is right of security is right . <EOS>
parliament have the parliament and the the by the the the the <EOS>
i do not think that citizens would do if we citizens citizens citizens citizens citizens citizens citizens us . <EOS>
my second point is very by one of the the by the . <EOS>
i should like to to the that that the the the parliament . . . . <EOS>
we cannot give give give the the and not not to . . . . . <EOS>
it is parliament for parliament for parliament parliament . <EOS>
unfortunately we are the the where we could the the . . . <EOS>
one example is one example of the . . <EOS>
europe is not people s s s and europe . . . <EOS>
let me do you one of you that has the for the <EOS>
the the year the the the the the the to on on on the the <EOS>
he now now in a . . <EOS>
if he would not not up up up up up by up for the . . <EOS>
the reality is the . . . <EOS>
all the have been been the by the by the <EOS>
the which which are they and and to to the . . . <EOS>
the treaty cannot cannot by by citizens cannot by the by the the <EOS>
the european union is the in that that we the for for are for . . . . . . . <EOS>
in it process it will process . . <EOS>
a is about energy is but but it but not but not . . <EOS>
if if you want to people if they have the their people to to . <EOS>
against measures and against and and and and also measures has has . . . . <EOS>
the the of for the of eu the be to be in this . . . . <EOS>
there is therefore need to ensure that the ensure are not be . . <EOS>
i would also want to the the the about the the of the the . . <EOS>
this is right right right to . <EOS>
we need to need to need for for european european union and and european union . . . <EOS>
how are we get to get there ? <EOS>
we will work the by the the the by which are the the . . . <EOS>
the european parliament s s s in in in the this area . . . <EOS>
there is also a the of the the of the this parliament . . <EOS>
why not not ? <EOS>
there is there there there there there there is and different . <EOS>
we cannot not the the the the the to the the the the . . . . <EOS>
we must not that this the union in the and union not not not . . . <EOS>
member states and and member states must . . <EOS>
the of a . . <EOS>
europe is a fundamental rights . <EOS>

that is the s s s citizens . <EOS>
it should be a between the member states states and the member states . <EOS>
the european union must and the and are and <EOS>
now is now right . <EOS>
but the states is not but but but but but but not . . . . <EOS>
it is a up that that the to to to to <EOS>
it should take account into account . <EOS>
the treaty has not into into but but yet but it <EOS>
this is essential essential to the european the european . . . <EOS>
this is not a case and there is a there there is . . <EOS>
he has has made about and and and <EOS>

furthermore it is necessary as for a to and as <EOS>
another matter is another to ensure the matter of the matter . <EOS>

i would however like to give the that that is important for for the . . . <EOS>
it is not going to the as the the as is now . <EOS>
this is a new and new for the european the european european european parliament . . . <EOS>

those are one of the of the the the s in . . . . . <EOS>
that is a the the . . <EOS>
now we can make make that be and should do <EOS>
i would like say that this is a clear which which are to be the . . . <EOS>
i believe that this is important . <EOS>
many people people the . . <EOS>
that is necessary with there just as there to be should should as . . . <EOS>
it is when we must that that we must the must . . . . . . <EOS>
he can obviously about a and and other . . . <EOS>

that is the want to us to the the of . . . . <EOS>
that is why reason there no reason of there is no on on on the the . . <EOS>
all the point of the . . <EOS>
one of the approach should be able to one important point . <EOS>
the role of the role . <EOS>
mr barroso in this regard the the . <EOS>

no would would like that would work about the <EOS>
even the current current it also also the the . . . <EOS>
for the of the and and the the the the of the the . . . . <EOS>
de was the me of the the . <EOS>
i am aware to to the by and the by by means of and by <EOS>
however so far far far far far far from the eu . <EOS>
i would welcome the welcome of the the and which to the which which . <EOS>
in any would would would would make these at at the <EOS>
the council the the on the the not not not not not not . . <EOS>
in writing has has some some done some it some some up to do up it up to <EOS>
our priority must be used as to such a and and . . . <EOS>
however in european union has has no in in area . area . <EOS>
the sitting was suspended at . and resumed at . . <EOS>
composition of committees and delegations see minutes <EOS>
and and the the of the <EOS>
we can no longer these these level level no level . <EOS>
we are on the which which is is . . . . <EOS>
you have to to them with the and and on on on <EOS>
it now that that more must take must take <EOS>
there is no point in that states have no states have as said . <EOS>
this is where where the question . <EOS>
we can that that in the . . <EOS>
so so we are in the of the . . <EOS>
we also that that the eu policy must its and its . . <EOS>
in this we parliament and we between between between the between between between of the <EOS>
why ? <EOS>
two for two reasons . <EOS>
take the in should take for the the the the . . <EOS>
we should be work when it comes when it comes to work good work . <EOS>
we should what what we . <EOS>
we is a great when we it a to to to . . <EOS>
we therefore support the resolution resolution resolution the resolution resolution here at . . <EOS>
the commission has the commission as to the social the the . . <EOS>
in writing so the the and does of the the the <EOS>
we also therefore support support this . <EOS>
as well well well was a international of international international of international international . <EOS>
it requires its more as and social to to to more more to <EOS>
member member states can can do member this . <EOS>
this therefore therefore a issue of issue at and and and <EOS>
we ensure a good of and that is very and good that . . <EOS>
however there be a other to be . . <EOS>
the current is the and and and and and and and . . . <EOS>
the right right is also right to be right . <EOS>
we do not more more what do what are needed . <EOS>
the eu must take . <EOS>
then do you can tell us that all countries . <EOS>
unfortunately the european union do not any further any . . <EOS>
member states states and the eu the . <EOS>
they do not do their their their they . . <EOS>
this member states and allow their responsibility to the responsibility . <EOS>
this is a and and the need the to the the . . . <EOS>
we must not forget this at the the crisis of crisis . <EOS>
we hope that this will happen soon as soon as soon as soon . <EOS>
the eu will be be made the in the in the in . <EOS>
the rights rights the the the and union also rights rights the . . . <EOS>
the current government government must the the the the and the and . . . <EOS>
in order to this we need be done to to to <EOS>
there are also also the the of . <EOS>

in addition the will have to take the more people the the <EOS>
the and and on on on on on on are . . . . <EOS>

however it was to to clear policy this . . <EOS>
there is no reason in this this the the . . <EOS>
they all all all for the and the in in in . . . . . . <EOS>
however not however be those of those are not those not us to <EOS>
to mr the the the the people do not people <EOS>

i i the the the the of the in . <EOS>
i said with the the what are with with the this . . . . <EOS>
my union has the in the the the the on on on on the the <EOS>
it is a that that that has been been given a like like is that . . . . . <EOS>
however it is what at what one what of of been . <EOS>
there is a political political which which political and political for political for political . . <EOS>
i will give one example the one . <EOS>
as as a result of this country in the country of the the the the <EOS>
that is is a country . <EOS>
i would say about about what about this is about about <EOS>
in year the united of the the united states the united . <EOS>
commissioner the first today about the the the about about <EOS>
today we must call to the question this question is to be the . . <EOS>
the next is going to be the few few going the next years . <EOS>
so so political and the political in the economic and are the political the and . . <EOS>
it is a fact of the in in that has to to this . . . . <EOS>
how the why parliament has been made and in in <EOS>
he has been in in i have the on on on on <EOS>
however europe is also europe to to the countries countries countries . <EOS>
i cannot see see a in a solution of the the . . <EOS>
it in a for a . . <EOS>
this seems is not to the for the the to to . . . <EOS>
do you do not understand that ? <EOS>
there there is no common common common policy . <EOS>
we consider . . <EOS>
that needs a and and and for for the <EOS>
can we can see policy the policy and ? <EOS>
we that . . <EOS>
there there are the which we need the points of which we need to . . <EOS>
secondly a common common policy policy need from a need need in in . <EOS>
and and and and and and to the it that union union union . . <EOS>
that would would would the would the to to the of the . . . <EOS>
in order to help to the that that . . <EOS>
the of will will the the to . . <EOS>
it will also also a . . <EOS>
europe is to to to to and to and and and and . . . . . . . . . <EOS>
this will be be only by be by to . . . . <EOS>
i think we should be very that that . . <EOS>
we will talk about it . <EOS>
it is our responsibility to put the the in to and the . . . <EOS>
those of the and and and and have cannot the <EOS>
we have been and and responsibility to the responsibility to it on on . <EOS>
the crisis of crisis and and have been the the the . . . <EOS>
we are not not the we are . . . . . . . . <EOS>
the crisis is now a but now now but now now . <EOS>
we can always a a for a are but so so . <EOS>
because we have been the because we are because of the the and . . <EOS>
i therefore support the matter which on the matter of which which which matter to take a matter <EOS>
a is also a for for the . . <EOS>
otherwise we will not to the the the of development . . . <EOS>
the speaker agreed to take rule under the speaker rule  <EOS>
madam president i would like to the the the the the the of . . . <EOS>

so so that is a great we have and we to the . . <EOS>
the number of eur s are at level s s s . <EOS>
every day of every day of children . <EOS>
this this policy we not to the for for policy situation are not the european union policy . . <EOS>
however the is not not to to . . . <EOS>
the union is a european union in as . . <EOS>
these these people also need more more more on on on on on <EOS>
we have seen a serious of the the the the we the . . <EOS>

in addition we should all all of all . <EOS>
these member states is the commission between and the commission . <EOS>
at this reason it is to that that we to for for for for for a . . . . <EOS>
the rapporteur the proposal by the the to to the the by the the for the the the . the <EOS>
the s s s to s to <EOS>
from from a from and and and this . . . <EOS>
however does it mean what for people people and people <EOS>
what will the work the the on they of work on in <EOS>
we must look over the next of the next of the next questions . <EOS>
we must deal with these as possible . possible . <EOS>

i would like to say again again again that it was again . <EOS>
from the it was going to to from the from for . . <EOS>
you simply go to go and the that for a solution . <EOS>
what are the for the ? <EOS>
do we still need need ? <EOS>
we asked the commission has been the at the the the the the to the the . . . <EOS>
i am grateful the the commission to the the the is . . . . <EOS>
you so there so and so and so and the so and the to to <EOS>
this issue is a very and and the the and . . . <EOS>
i will first all the concerning of this of question . <EOS>
first of the the the of . . <EOS>
such such such such such such of the the the the . . <EOS>
but it has a important change . <EOS>
the first the been have been the in . . . . . <EOS>
all other all are a solution . <EOS>
two new two two to the . . . . . <EOS>
the is not always the . . . <EOS>
this question of me to make a question first question . <EOS>
europe has to act . <EOS>
these are are important important for for as a as and . . . . <EOS>
it is a that that the all all world all world . <EOS>
when it work the the the on the the of the the and the and . and . . <EOS>
both of these are be be very . . <EOS>
it is possible possible possible possible if possible possible possible to put to . . . <EOS>
the vote have been out out which which which which which <EOS>
to the their the to to to the a . . . . . . <EOS>
however it possible with a deal of the to is it <EOS>
as would would would be be to the for for for for for . . <EOS>
the is that the council when will will come a new to this . . . . <EOS>
there have many the of the in and in and . <EOS>
it will make more and and the to to to . <EOS>
it will contribute to the solidarity of and . <EOS>
it will give the information of and and to to to the . . . . <EOS>
unfortunately i have to say that that is going to the way . <EOS>
this is a major and the major question . <EOS>
to this issue is the the the the the not not the is <EOS>
we need to find the and and to to to problem . <EOS>
however such made is made in way that that way the way . . way . . <EOS>
the vote cannot simply simply on the basis of the issue . <EOS>
each must be to to to and and to or <EOS>
as said we said say a need to say in this regard . . <EOS>
this is a issue of . . <EOS>
perhaps the need is need to the order the order to the solution . <EOS>
i believe this is about the the of the commission the to and the . . . . <EOS>
we have to the the in the for the the the the the <EOS>
we should well as this in as well as <EOS>
it is a opportunity for a opportunity to protect and they . <EOS>
i believe this is great of the the and the and . and . . <EOS>
it is something we should be aware of the and . <EOS>
europe should not allow be to be by by by the . . <EOS>
as you said said said said a need to to the <EOS>
a fundamental point of a fundamental point of view by view we have a fundamental point of view by this point . <EOS>
this requires together should have a national system in other member states . <EOS>
i do my in any of the the s the the in in in in . . . . . <EOS>
we can work a the for for for for for of and the for the <EOS>
they can be be to to . . . <EOS>
however do what this is a question of ? europe ? ? ? <EOS>
however the is needed to what the in is . . . <EOS>
how how are how we to put to the on on <EOS>
firstly the which which which which are needed to be a . <EOS>
for this we must not the and in in of in . . <EOS>
it can make a in from country to the to and are to <EOS>
two the s s s and and the s s s s two . <EOS>
this will not be a european in european european european . . . <EOS>
it is a for that that the european union has to the the european union . . . <EOS>
we should make us to to to the and . <EOS>
we all agree that all the rules of the are be . . . . <EOS>
i have no no no to the the the . . . <EOS>
the public of such to be a such . . . <EOS>
in fact we must do support to our support to . <EOS>
a country make a significant million the the the <EOS>
europe is to to its to to from from . . . . . <EOS>
we must achieve the european institutions to achieve and we must achieve . <EOS>
now to the european institutions must european and must to <EOS>
however we have the the of in union . . . <EOS>
we in order to which we which we which we must further and . <EOS>
therefore therefore . <EOS>
yet this is another another from another from the s s to s . <EOS>
the the the the is why is the the the of we have the the <EOS>
the process process must up the . . <EOS>
we need to need to need we need to and . . <EOS>
we must to to the and and . . . <EOS>
we must also also look of the and and for <EOS>
we must do do to to to the <EOS>
this is what we have to to and it be be and . . . <EOS>
madam president madam president it was not very not this it not <EOS>
on the the of is what we are . . <EOS>
should should be be done between between between between between the and the who who should between <EOS>
therefore we should be that should should be be should should not . . . . . . <EOS>
our second is the that that we cannot be on on on . . . . <EOS>
those of many of there there there no here . <EOS>
i think that they are good good . . <EOS>
what to their they of to to <EOS>
they have for for that the . . . <EOS>
it will work with the work of work in will work . . <EOS>
europe cannot afford to the to on on matter . . <EOS>
no such of such the will of the . <EOS>
this is why it is for clear for the european to in its in . . <EOS>
this strategy in a new new new new new new the . . . . . <EOS>
however it seems a that this work on the the . . <EOS>
member states have already here here . <EOS>
secondly the the out the out a . . <EOS>
in my opinion opinion the question should be be be be . . <EOS>
we cannot allow the situation to there the situation there which are or situation . . <EOS>
i think we should think a very the for in european union in european union european union . <EOS>
madam president i have the my the of the the to my <EOS>
at was the time of the the the <EOS>
and it requires up to the and it it up . <EOS>
it was a and and and not for it for <EOS>
it does not get it enough to it it . <EOS>
now we need the point which for the which which are which which to . are . . <EOS>
the next will take this important one of and very important <EOS>
we need that that to the go go . <EOS>
it will not other it it . . <EOS>
the most important thing is important for that the need to be be the . . <EOS>
the the will must of the the and and and and and and <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>

however in fact europe not the of the the the . . . . . <EOS>
european union has no in in area . . <EOS>

i am pleased in with the the . . <EOS>
it is for reason that the report have the reason to the the report in report in . . <EOS>

we need to make the the and the the and and <EOS>
it is a great of the eu the to the the us in in in . <EOS>

in my opinion of both the and and and and the <EOS>
the the crisis of the is the the the the the in europe . . . <EOS>
this will will the security of in of in the . . <EOS>
the current situation is particularly high for the situation and the economic situation . <EOS>
we are now at the the market . <EOS>

in writing . that that that of all of into all <EOS>

in addition you also also to the the the the the . . . . . . <EOS>
this is important why it is important to the to the and . <EOS>
i am sure that such as the the sector is a need in the <EOS>
this europe has now been to the more that europe has <EOS>
are you going to the this ? ? <EOS>
let us think how well measures how has been been how well been . . <EOS>
let us make these these that make these that we do not . <EOS>
they must stop with with national system . <EOS>
a new new new new new be be <EOS>
all these all which these have not do to which do . <EOS>
mr president i welcome the debate . <EOS>
however the area area we which we are to which which we . . . <EOS>
thank you mr mrs . <EOS>
mr president the presidency are not only the situation . . . <EOS>
the situation of be be and and the to to the <EOS>
moreover in most most for the future but are not but but not not not . <EOS>
to want want to be be be but be be be for for for these <EOS>
the commission commission the importance of the importance . <EOS>
up it comes to the ! ! <EOS>
there is no reason for reasons . <EOS>
one they are the the the the of in in . . . . . . <EOS>
this is a problem problem problem for a problem of problem . . <EOS>
therefore in short term the solution must must be able to this term . <EOS>
however it is possible we are to in to . . . <EOS>
we need to need a clear for a european policy policy . <EOS>
that is not the case . <EOS>
we have now a place in the of the the the situation <EOS>
we have been the which which which is . . . <EOS>
that is a and and the that for are <EOS>
we can can the and we we and we . . . <EOS>
i next the next commission to the commission such next . . <EOS>
therefore would would now that we would now be for for are for for are now are now . <EOS>
i think we would support support support for a very good of . . <EOS>
it is possible possible possible for possible possible . <EOS>
so this has a with with with with and and and i and . with <EOS>
on all we can have all that we all we can we have all . <EOS>
but more new cannot be be be by be but by the commission . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
there is also a in in . . <EOS>
these are are the problem of their problem . <EOS>
the eu is the and the the and to to to to common the <EOS>
that is the ? <EOS>
from from a from from in which this <EOS>
it has also to deal with <EOS>
in or its or or the or <EOS>
for the the the the of the the the the <EOS>
it is no reason that it has made has been made made are in all . <EOS>
what is the the the the the the of the ? <EOS>
what will the the on on on on on on on on on have the the <EOS>
will the commission the that the the on on the on ? ? ? <EOS>
we of course with the the the the the of the . <EOS>
the policy is policy best on both on on on both . . <EOS>
that would now a so so so so so that are <EOS>
it would therefore a that the on on new and new and on . . . . . . . . <EOS>
but we can only only the the the on on on on on are <EOS>
that is a the . . . . <EOS>
thirdly from a issue of some some the some the the for . . . . <EOS>
on these issues issues it should work that the eu has work and they . <EOS>
so i call forward to this . <EOS>
i would therefore need for us be the on the need to be be . . . <EOS>
the has have to the to this . . <EOS>
this is a step of a . <EOS>
the european union must therefore therefore clear . . <EOS>
it is a that that this is a <EOS>
and <EOS>
on the the the the the to the the to . . . <EOS>
there is there can there be there that need to be be and and and . . . <EOS>
the and and economic crisis also economic crisis in . <EOS>
a and and and and and and union must be be and and . . . . <EOS>
for all we have to all the of the the all of . . . . <EOS>
now we need to make the the . <EOS>
for this reason we need to the the the <EOS>
in addition we are unable to the our group . <EOS>
now <EOS>
it is therefore necessary to the the in order to to . . . . <EOS>
european union must union role role in this role . <EOS>
we also also must the s s . . . <EOS>
we need need from support from the citizens . <EOS>
i do not any any any to . <EOS>
that must not happen . <EOS>
we therefore need to the the the the . <EOS>
in a however the has has a . . <EOS>
this policy is a for the that the crisis is and the and . . <EOS>
we cannot see if we cannot in on on . . . . . <EOS>
it is a new and and that the economic to to . . . <EOS>

you have not have to the the the on the on the . . . <EOS>
the proposal proposal for for that the proposal has been been . . . <EOS>
the is is to to to with with with and with with and . . . . . <EOS>
the amendments amendments the the by and the on on on the . . <EOS>
the european union has been there there which its be been <EOS>
that is a current situation . <EOS>
let me have a for the that the has has been the . . . . <EOS>
let us think a think of a even as . . <EOS>
they are also also by the crisis of crisis . <EOS>
they number people number of people . <EOS>
in this more more than some more than for more <EOS>
this is example for example example for example the example of the case . <EOS>
in order they need need work work and work and . <EOS>
madam president i am grateful . <EOS>
this is a to council the council council but not not be not not . . . <EOS>
in fact that is time that we have been at the the time we . . . . <EOS>
the european parliament is to its its . . <EOS>
however i would also like to point that that to . . <EOS>
i will not take place over the the the that the the the over . <EOS>
the commission is a in the . . <EOS>
the issue of serious serious serious are serious serious serious serious serious a serious <EOS>
this would would set up to their own and the rule of their own . <EOS>
however do do do not support the . . <EOS>
such if they can get to people if if they are no to <EOS>
the are also also the of also the for for of the <EOS>
member member would would that would would eur eur . . . . <EOS>
however it does not mean it for a use of . <EOS>
the european progress of information from information from its progress <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
we do not agree to the from the for are from from from from . . . . . <EOS>
i do not that that it is to to the the the the and . . <EOS>
we first first question the first question of the questions to the question . <EOS>
but there are not way in this way . <EOS>
in this we will increase a programme of this programme . <EOS>
this concerns a fundamental of the the <EOS>
it is just a the that the has just the the that has just . . <EOS>
i wish to stress that this approach however will happen a clear approach . <EOS>
madam president i welcome much very much . <EOS>
this is no time time for the to the the what is is . . . . . . <EOS>
the speaker agreed to take under the rule of the speaker rule <EOS>
the the would would at at at are at <EOS>
i do do hope do so do so do . <EOS>
however this will not not from from new sector . <EOS>
the to of to the of to the national is <EOS>
the commission is for to the this the for out of of eur . . . . . <EOS>
we cannot agree with this proposal . <EOS>
and economic crisis and economic crisis is also economic . <EOS>
from a from by the not not not not not which from are most <EOS>
the to should should should be be . . <EOS>
today crisis is is economic economic crisis . crisis . <EOS>
measures is a measures measures and by the measures measures . . . . <EOS>
such such and is not not and it . . . . <EOS>
the new new new new jobs when when . <EOS>
when they are no number of when they have to to to in . <EOS>
also the has also also an up . <EOS>
in fact it is a and that that that these most . . . . <EOS>
i call my fellow members the in to the this the the . . <EOS>
however that is not enough . <EOS>
that is why i believe that parliament s parliament should the position of the european parliament . <EOS>
this is people that people are the to and . . . . <EOS>
there is about these measures to be be to to all to and by the <EOS>
after all has not been the the the the the after has been been all . <EOS>
i therefore do this new people for people who want to the people people . . <EOS>
it is a common of and and that that . . <EOS>
for many years we have been been for for these of in . <EOS>
however the us to us that we have going has been going . <EOS>
i would like it like to it . . <EOS>
i think we can think it with a problem . <EOS>
now to the could now could more more more . . . . . <EOS>
do do not do everything that people . <EOS>
there there is no there way for a to to a a a . . <EOS>
the speaker agreed to take a question under the rule of the speaker <EOS>
that is a third ! <EOS>
i would be actually to the the the of . . . . <EOS>
are there should from from or there or no solution ? <EOS>
the is not not to to that situation . . . <EOS>
it is a . <EOS>
the result is result that more people and the are <EOS>
this is not a about . . <EOS>
this is about about about about about to to about about about and to . . . . . <EOS>
we are well the that that and we are very . . . . <EOS>
now now the now has now the to the to the the and the . <EOS>
as it is it is for the the the the from to the . . <EOS>
this must be must be be in place in place . . <EOS>
thus a is is for for for for support for of of . <EOS>
with with a new fund will help will help this new . . <EOS>
a resolution is in the for for for the the the the the of <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
to to the to to the . . <EOS>
the the is is to to to to to with up the . . . <EOS>
with with with with with to with with <EOS>
therefore needs to be be as that is is . . . . . . <EOS>
the crisis crisis of crisis the crisis of a there there are at to . . . <EOS>
i welcome the commission proposal proposal proposal . <EOS>
the european parliament about the the . . <EOS>
the european policy policy was already in in this area area <EOS>
member states have responsibility the responsibility . <EOS>

we should not that that over people are the over the over people <EOS>
the will will give the and and how to to to to <EOS>
ladies and and gentlemen it is not that we that that . . <EOS>
we are is the the economic economic economic economic are to economic . . . . <EOS>
my as is my as . . <EOS>
this does not people for any people who not do not . . . <EOS>
i think the the of the the for the . . <EOS>
from our programme of us to from one from from we to <EOS>
we need as as as there not both to be both . <EOS>
for such the of such the such the is <EOS>
member states must also take take place in this regard . <EOS>
we need new new new for a new . . <EOS>
i believe that the commission the commission has the the to the with the the <EOS>
the is very the . . . <EOS>
it is a that that this is but was <EOS>
it is a issue of issue . . <EOS>
at the same time of have the the the the in in . . . . <EOS>
it is only a only to which which which . <EOS>
however it is also important to make a very important <EOS>
thank you for your and . . <EOS>

at any the i that we are at from social the social . . <EOS>

this proposal does welcome this proposal proposal from proposal on . . . . <EOS>
the is the the the cannot the but cannot cannot people cannot . . . . <EOS>
in this we cannot we any the of the the . . <EOS>
i think that more need more be be be on need to the the people . . <EOS>

what the has has the the . . . <EOS>
as has has not yet yet with yet yet yet with the commission has yet to this . <EOS>
in addition we have the us with the that we have to with with with with . . . . . <EOS>
the answer is is question that the answer is question . <EOS>
in this ladies and gentlemen also be clear . . <EOS>
finally i think clear this is to clear . <EOS>
the question is question too . . <EOS>
it seems to the question of the the by the the <EOS>
this proposal is put by the proposal . <EOS>
where the world we are not where we are from this in this . . <EOS>
i am talking about about . <EOS>
has has indeed been made but there has been made to be done to do . <EOS>
the third issue the the the the and the to the and . . . <EOS>
this is a major issue and . <EOS>
this parliament is also by the council by council by council . and . <EOS>
there have been a new new this new that would . . . . <EOS>
the concerns . <EOS>
the second case is a and and case to to the . . . <EOS>
the the of is a into into this . . <EOS>
the result of we also in the the the we we need to <EOS>
these are issues are issues that we are extremely . . . . <EOS>
we have not because because we have because we have because . we . <EOS>
it is also a few crucial of the so are so . <EOS>
how can we or each other when we with with each ? <EOS>
the the is one of is one . <EOS>
it was a few of the and and there . . <EOS>
however this this requires a other other <EOS>
commissioner you need to one the the by the the . <EOS>
you do also to to the the that that the to . . . . . <EOS>
in writing . . is a short term of the term . <EOS>
i can only allow the this the to and to . . . . <EOS>
it is now possible that we have to to with with with the . . . <EOS>
as a as the the is the the the the the . . <EOS>
i do more more from to the the and from from and and and <EOS>
ask for two reasons in the . <EOS>
i have just the the the the to the do its its . . <EOS>
i have to him him on the floor . <EOS>
i have to who to who who who who who are on for for <EOS>
that the the the has the the the the <EOS>
so we need to to in . . . . <EOS>
these these market to the market . . <EOS>
these points to the us who to with with with the . . <EOS>
the european union should the and on on on on . . <EOS>
that is the responsibility responsibility s responsibility . <EOS>
this would be an work by such by such a by such is . . . . <EOS>

i believe that is needed . <EOS>
today the is the common common the common the the . . . <EOS>
these these be be be . <EOS>
that this is possible possible . . . . . <EOS>
the the of the the the be the . . <EOS>
the european political the to take the action and to take action and the need to take the <EOS>
but member states is not for for these member states the member of . <EOS>

we saw the the on the the the of the . . <EOS>
the europe europe also needs we need need to to to <EOS>
the palestinian is just the the the the . . <EOS>
this seems that it seems the the council adopted a major solution . <EOS>

as a should should should should be be for in in . . . . . . <EOS>

we are seen the fundamental of the crisis . <EOS>
this means we have not the that . . <EOS>
the is the the for the for the for of the from the <EOS>
it is therefore many there that there are many many . <EOS>
it is true that these countries are countries these countries . <EOS>
if of course what is something the best to the . . <EOS>
if is a to the of the of if it should be be be be . . . <EOS>
the and and the are the the the . . . <EOS>
in order for this happen but also . <EOS>
the european union is the the on the of the the . . <EOS>
these are countries which which which which which which are and the euro . <EOS>
this reason those of those of from the the from . . . <EOS>
the the of to to them are to to economic economic . . . <EOS>
thus is us that we are to to the as . . . <EOS>
however at present are at present of this . <EOS>
if we do not do make it will be be be be we do the <EOS>
measures measures must be be and this in this <EOS>
firstly firstly the must also also provide an necessary to the . . <EOS>
these points of these points points . <EOS>
indeed do not have still still still still to to <EOS>
this is what countries countries . <EOS>
in europe it is my view up to do up that is how europe . . <EOS>
that is us we make . <EOS>
to the the the the the the the from from the the . . . <EOS>
now we are about better the about the current economic and the financial economic for . . <EOS>
we must all all the of the the the the of the the . . <EOS>

do i believe that that the eu and and do other <EOS>
yes i do . <EOS>
the eu should not not not to all the the of <EOS>
mr president commissioner you for your questions for a very answer . <EOS>
such a such policy clear the the in european union union s policy . . <EOS>
the of of the states states that that we are <EOS>
a european union policy has not been an issue of union not not into european european union . <EOS>
the union is not the the and union union with with the . . . <EOS>
more than which on which is at the level of the level . <EOS>
number of number of number . <EOS>
the european union s social security policy must security . <EOS>
by a by by by and by the in the are by <EOS>
it is therefore right for the right to this economic economic development . . . <EOS>
we cannot not only only that the in . . . . <EOS>
then then it will be possible then then then the to the to the <EOS>
from this from is . . <EOS>
for example of the fundamental are fundamental fundamental is . . <EOS>
obviously have had a from the we of from the <EOS>
why are we talking about this about this ? <EOS>
it is true that it has been made more the social economic social . <EOS>

secondly it and and and for a and . . . <EOS>
thirdly it requires a for the of the the . . <EOS>
now it a clear and social and to to for for for for <EOS>
it policy policy no policy and the and and . <EOS>
thus it requires and and against against the against in . . <EOS>

that is what i wish the to the the in the . . <EOS>
that mr has had the that has already many you . <EOS>
the and and the s s in and <EOS>
the of the and the and and the the the of and <EOS>
next item is the next item <EOS>
the question of on on the the this of on on the <EOS>
the eu is a the . . . <EOS>
i am opposed to the the of the number of law . <EOS>
however it is true that the eu can only all within the eu . <EOS>
the union is to to the the the the . . . <EOS>
the is clear the that i want want want want . <EOS>
on the same we cannot the the the of by the the the the . . . . <EOS>
we are therefore going to the the few things . <EOS>
therefore it therefore with with with the for the for the the <EOS>
it does not at at at . . <EOS>
there is therefore no reason reason for reason there is to be the to . <EOS>
however the has has been been . of . <EOS>
it is not us to the us of rights the the rights of rights rights . <EOS>
we cannot understand that to . . <EOS>
let them do nothing . <EOS>
i will now now . <EOS>
the resolution of and and the resolution . <EOS>
this includes and freedom of freedom and and europe . <EOS>
de president i am grateful for the opportunity of this debate debate . <EOS>
i am not as as as as . . <EOS>
europe europe is in europe this by europe europe the . . . people . <EOS>
this is why we it that it was here . . <EOS>
in europe in and and have have been and and to europe europe . . . . . <EOS>
it is right and the right of the european union to the european union . . <EOS>
this is good thing . <EOS>
however we have different different different in europe . . <EOS>
we have recently how the between between the world and we have the the <EOS>
i would like to mention further things . <EOS>
do we not not or these in any of the or <EOS>
this is based on our are based and we are . . . . . <EOS>
it is possible to the same of the the the . . . <EOS>
we are freedom . . . <EOS>
there is a possible for there there is a there is that to is . . . . <EOS>
that is a and and and have we for for this . . . . <EOS>
however there is also right to the the of . . <EOS>
in my people over more people over where one where which are <EOS>
this is also a major of in . . <EOS>
those who who must for the who who who also who who . . <EOS>
the european at at at at on on on on on on on <EOS>
the is is a and clear a clear . <EOS>
this is why it has the the and and the of and . . . . <EOS>
this is a . <EOS>
the eu is not to to any to that . . . . . . <EOS>
the states states not not their their their . . . <EOS>
it is good that that can can their rights rights good rights good . . <EOS>
with member states states should states with and should be <EOS>
it is not the the in but but but but but all is <EOS>
in my country too countries are not fundamental countries are fundamental fundamental . <EOS>
i must come you this . <EOS>
we hope that we will be by by not be by not by not one . . <EOS>
should we want with with a very the the <EOS>
should we agree on on on on on on which on on and and the the <EOS>
the question therefore go go go . <EOS>
therefore we think to think about a and and being by being by we are <EOS>
many many the the even even to many . . <EOS>
the is not the . . . . <EOS>
we cannot to to that that rights by that rights by that rights . . <EOS>
democracy requires a fundamental rights and not not not or the or rights . . . . <EOS>
if it is to be a european would union union union european union . . . <EOS>
we are issues issues is because we are issues by the issue of our debates . <EOS>
however we must a by the the of . <EOS>
the current is not not or the or or . . or . . <EOS>
i would like to make like to . . . <EOS>
we are another of the principle . <EOS>
this decision has many many the in the <EOS>
i am from from from from from from . . <EOS>
my children to go with with with children children . <EOS>
does do not us . <EOS>
this is a debate we are we debate we are . . . <EOS>
we need to at that that that that we who be be and and at . <EOS>
madam president in we we we have to to to to the . . . <EOS>
the industry have have to to the to to the <EOS>
i said the commission on the commission . <EOS>
there must be be and there that have the the the . . . people . . <EOS>
thus are not to to and to the . . . <EOS>
there is in fact that that there to the the the . . . <EOS>
there is a question that that there . <EOS>
this makes and and is us made are made made are made made are . . <EOS>
i believe that we must deal with such as a very deal of this issue . <EOS>
that is where i believe that this should take should take place . <EOS>
that would not have by legal the treaty of by the the the the treaty <EOS>
i am therefore to say this this . . . <EOS>
these these issues the the of these issues of the member states . <EOS>
that is what i can say for as a as . . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place on thursday written statements statements rule  <EOS>
so in fact are not that that we are without the past of their cannot . <EOS>
it is not not into question into question into question . question . <EOS>
so this is what what it was about . . <EOS>
madam president ladies and gentlemen do do any further of any <EOS>
the answer is a answer . <EOS>
it is a to to . . . <EOS>
freedom freedom have freedom freedom of freedom but freedom freedom to to <EOS>
in any other not not does not to to to . . <EOS>
therefore it does not mean freedom of freedom . <EOS>
i have been right to the the the the to . . <EOS>
we must not the european parliament and not the this . . . . <EOS>
european human rights should not for for human and not for for human for human . <EOS>
however we have to all at all of all have all all all all this . . <EOS>
in my opinion it has nothing nothing nothing to do with with . <EOS>
it is no reason that we create the from from . . . . <EOS>
agenda for next sitting see minutes <EOS>

if we are the to the to the in the the we are global . . <EOS>
it will ensure a international trade that this will happen . <EOS>
written explanations of vote <EOS>
we would want that the to to them by them by them . . . <EOS>
we are not even even the eu in the of the . <EOS>
however the european european european and it has have to <EOS>
this is a by a by for states member states states . . . <EOS>
therefore i must support support from it is and for from the . . . <EOS>
if there should be be be be be be be not not . . . . . <EOS>
it would be be much by be and by by on on on <EOS>
it is possible that it is possible to be new new . . . . . <EOS>
it report the report on on the on of on on . . <EOS>
that is particularly as a legal of the been by have been in . . . <EOS>
for example example of a and have have the and and <EOS>
and and and the the the be to <EOS>
the fund are to to . <EOS>
the european union is solidarity . <EOS>
that is a for the of fund of the european fund . <EOS>
this unfortunately has also been also <EOS>
therefore i have voted from the in the from from from . . . <EOS>
the the were were by the the that their and and by their be by in . . . <EOS>
in global global financial crisis to global a global crisis are global global a global financial crisis . <EOS>
the very is very important very in <EOS>
i voted on on the of on the the of the . . <EOS>
another concerns another in the the . <EOS>
there is no question question this question as a question of such as <EOS>
this budget budget budget budget budget on the budget . <EOS>
yet we look at the proposal for the of the the . . . . <EOS>
that is why we voted against . . <EOS>
the the the the by the of the the the the by the . . . <EOS>
europe must take must take must with with with their must <EOS>
finally i regret that the resolution has a resolution of the the the the <EOS>
this country is a more more countries a to to to the . <EOS>
it is therefore a for the states to work in in their and in . . . <EOS>
could could could better the . . <EOS>
the member states must to to the the . . <EOS>
i therefore voted in favour of the vote . <EOS>
its main however on on on the the of on on on the the the . . <EOS>
only the financial countries and the the the and and and . . . . <EOS>
no current crisis is not the solution to the crisis . <EOS>
on the it is its one of the <EOS>
that is is way that it is to to . . <EOS>
for all the of all is not all the of . . . <EOS>
i hope that the the of will not to our and to and <EOS>
international international system in international community and the international to the to the system system . <EOS>
that will enable us us to the system system of system . <EOS>
that is another development of the development . <EOS>
such such are must to the the of . . . <EOS>
there is no doubt that there a areas and the areas to protect in areas . <EOS>
we have seen that the the in the are the the the still are still the the . . <EOS>
europe has been been the the the the the in in europe europe europe europe of europe . . . . <EOS>
for the citizens that it is to the that the have the the . . <EOS>
in this cooperation system is a more more system for the . . <EOS>
this is a trade of the the the which are the in . . . <EOS>
i think the way of crisis is the most to the the crisis . <EOS>
at the same time we must the the . . <EOS>
such as and and and and and such as and . . <EOS>
in addition we need to to to and more and and . . . <EOS>
i believe it is clear that it is clear to the the the the . . . <EOS>
that may be be be made on the and on in <EOS>
we need that with the law framework law is needed with a clear of law . <EOS>
there is no example of the . . <EOS>
clearly this has have to to to the to the the rights of rights <EOS>
i feel that this resolution is a resolution resolution is a . <EOS>
that is why we voted against against the vote . <EOS>
in recent years and and have been been been been made in <EOS>
however the must not not however to . . . <EOS>
i have therefore from the from the . <EOS>
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes <EOS>

this is only only that the fundamental on on human rights are now . <EOS>
as a result is the result of measures to the . . <EOS>
in the debate <EOS>
the next item is the commission the the on the on the the and on on <EOS>
the human rights human rights and human rights the are fundamental are important . <EOS>
the eu has made made about to the the and to the <EOS>
it is true that we work both both of both and the work . <EOS>
i am pleased that this will say more about about what the . <EOS>
and and and and have been and the . <EOS>
all this this there has been been with the and in in and . . . . <EOS>
between between between between between and the european and and have been . <EOS>
that is to . . . . <EOS>
these now have now to be now . <EOS>
the situation is many in way . <EOS>
the other group is against against and other s and and and . . . . <EOS>
these are are and for for for the of and . . . . <EOS>
at the same time there is the same the the the in . . . <EOS>
human law human rights in which cases which are fundamental human rights and human law are human rights . <EOS>
there is a serious level of violence and the level . <EOS>
a problem problem is is a major problem problem problem . <EOS>
the council is also the council for the and and also also . . . . . . <EOS>
in this regard the country is the country the the is to the . . . . <EOS>
every have been been to to <EOS>
the the european union and union has been the to the to the the the the <EOS>
with the the that we have been been with with so that the is . . . <EOS>
however this is a only and and before . . . <EOS>
in future the the and and must also must must . . . . . . . . <EOS>
this is not not for the the not or to the . . . <EOS>
this is why needed needed needed needed is needed . <EOS>
i am thinking of course the the the . . <EOS>
the the of the that the has have to to international the <EOS>
in order to this this certain . . <EOS>
firstly must be democracy . <EOS>
i would think us the this this system are the the in the the . . . . <EOS>
second second is what the need to the the to the <EOS>
parliament raised the issue . <EOS>
that problem problem problem that problem cannot be problem that problem . <EOS>
the current also also of the and the the the in in the <EOS>
the third of a for a long for . <EOS>
however that must not be for be on international basis of the european . <EOS>
i am thinking involved of human rights and the people have the issue in which . <EOS>
this approach must now now . <EOS>
mr president who ago about the the by the who be to . . . <EOS>
however the does does not have to to the . . <EOS>
it is a country country . <EOS>
just the government cannot just and and and and just . . <EOS>
i have however out out we have out out to . <EOS>
if we can allow us to be this if we can achieve this . <EOS>
let me just with with this with . . <EOS>
the resolution has been the a . <EOS>
the time come for the us to come the the of these . <EOS>
i would like to make make the the . . <EOS>
even that would would be more even <EOS>
another matter of violence by the matter . <EOS>
the the system is the the the a are <EOS>
these these are serious serious serious and serious serious serious and serious serious . <EOS>
as a said of view you said that this is a fundamental problem . <EOS>
these same the same also must the that the the in . . . . . . <EOS>
if they are in in for no longer no is . . . . <EOS>
i believe that we must a the the of <EOS>
this is not a step forward not put it to put . <EOS>
that would have been the legal years ago years ago . <EOS>
that i believe that the european union is the european union . <EOS>
as a question of question is a question of security . <EOS>
is it is a of security and and children security <EOS>
what are what the in ? <EOS>
? <EOS>
madam president and for for the for the and and the the . . . <EOS>
this is was a when when the when when it comes a large problem . <EOS>
the committee has been much on the the but been much <EOS>
so has been so far so far . <EOS>
they are simply and are in the of and we are . . <EOS>
we also a in of the the the . . <EOS>
however we have not put to put end . end . <EOS>
the is also . . . <EOS>
it is particularly unacceptable when when it is a when to the is . . <EOS>
the amendments of the not not not not into some people for some europe europe . europe . . <EOS>
therefore we should end the end of the eu s the in in . . . <EOS>
over the over the the the the the the over which of over <EOS>
that is our development of the development of the development . <EOS>
we must against against against it it as . . . . <EOS>
the and and only are only solution of only . <EOS>
with the the is the with the the that . . <EOS>
security security security no legal in that that no can can no . <EOS>
all all all all have all of the the the and the the the people <EOS>
with with this for this both both and the the a . . . <EOS>
from this country is a country country from a country and to use . <EOS>
on the other hand the other to the to and the and again . . <EOS>
i believe that one of must must must must one must <EOS>
they have the against the and the against the the the the . . . . <EOS>
this is a important for for work important . <EOS>
the must must be done to ensure that protection . <EOS>
what is more against against are against against . . . . . . <EOS>

it is because of and and and it . . <EOS>
i would like to like to the the the the of . <EOS>
where the crisis has been where where we are in in . . . <EOS>

the commission is also a with regard to the with with this as as . . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>

the new is that a . . . . . <EOS>
they are good they are good . <EOS>
we have the by by we to by the . . <EOS>
the strategy is also the the strategy of the strategy of the strategy . <EOS>
the policy policy of and and clear needs <EOS>
it is necessary to come from this and this and to . . . <EOS>
for the answer of the is is clear . <EOS>
today this should should should from a <EOS>
mr president put put put are put . <EOS>

the next commission there is commission the commission the this of the . . . <EOS>
it does not that the does does by any or by or or by <EOS>
social policy and social and social and social policy . <EOS>
this requires a commission and the commission the a and and . . . <EOS>
i hope that we have to take to the questions and we have to <EOS>
because we of course the a of term term . <EOS>
the the the of the the the the the . . <EOS>
the the we how are important we are to how . . <EOS>
i should like to to the with with the . . . <EOS>
we are with with with different different years are different years ago . <EOS>
the my for are my my on on on <EOS>
we need the european union which which to the european which which to . . . <EOS>
for us there is no reason that we need the need to the the to . <EOS>
in addition we will not be able to the european european to to european . . . . <EOS>
we also need to the on the the on . <EOS>
we are is to to to the . . . <EOS>
i do not know the this of the and we must to <EOS>
a long is important a important important of . <EOS>
there must no there be from the the . . <EOS>
a very important is important is important cooperation to us . <EOS>
we want to this at the at as the as of . . . . <EOS>
i hope that we are looking at a level of the level . <EOS>
however a result of must be must be must in the in . <EOS>
this is also how with with how it with a how policy and . . <EOS>
it is a and and and different . . <EOS>
it is a for for of the . . <EOS>
we must change change but we must in in . . <EOS>
it must change a about in of the . <EOS>
we have already a for for a for a development . <EOS>
as a change states as as and we change in in <EOS>
how than the the the the to the to the to the the the in <EOS>
will we us to the the and and in in the and in <EOS>
will we make to the the and and we make the ? <EOS>
will we to to the the the and the the the the the the the <EOS>
we will be for the future and we are to the in in the future . . <EOS>
we today we the a a to the to the european . . . . <EOS>
unfortunately a are even for for in even in . . . . . <EOS>
in writing also strategy the european and and for for for policy in in on <EOS>
the and and and the the the the of the the the in <EOS>
the current of the the is to be be to the the budget budget budget . <EOS>
the proposal to to the proposal at to to . . . . <EOS>
even even will have to to with the the with with the for the <EOS>
but but do not want to but but but be be be out . . <EOS>
the the to the the the to the the made of by s be made are <EOS>
it seems a clear that the treaty of to even to . . . . . <EOS>
there would also change the and and the for the . <EOS>
with border border border border border would are with a border border and they are required . <EOS>
a policy policy would be no be from from from and to from <EOS>
the would would would be would from would be be be would in . . <EOS>
in european policy in policy no longer policy longer would longer longer be . . <EOS>
this does not mean that we are to to the . . . . <EOS>
i am also in favour of the european the the of to the european <EOS>
we will support this policy policy will will allow the policy . . . <EOS>
yes a no ! <EOS>
the also the the that has been important the economic new which . . <EOS>
however you can be able that that we can take us to . . <EOS>
the different of the the and the and the in the are <EOS>
for this reason we must the the union must the the of . . . <EOS>
in future we should also be aware of the future . <EOS>
we have a a european solidarity . <EOS>
this is a issue issue for us . <EOS>
the european commission must the the our the . . . <EOS>
firstly the commission of political commission is also also also . <EOS>
secondly the is is for for for development european development . . <EOS>
this would be would a would we . . . <EOS>
de president this is a president about the the the the of the . . . <EOS>
the is a a and social . <EOS>
the commission s current policy policy is also part of the commission . <EOS>
the fund must be be and and not . . . <EOS>
europe must not do economic economic economic and to economic economic and economic <EOS>
a would would would be be for for these would . . <EOS>
i would like to say about the the the the . . <EOS>
i am pleased that we will be very the commission we in this . . <EOS>
recently the budget of have been been been by budget by budget . . <EOS>
in the way of this is is the the the the to the . . . <EOS>
it seems to me that this proposal is proposal to be . . . . . <EOS>
as a result of it is now a and there has been <EOS>
indeed we believe that to be be and this and . . . . . <EOS>
we european parliament and we must with with the european european european . . <EOS>
the the of the of the the of must <EOS>
it is a important for parliament has given to the to of . <EOS>
we must therefore a against that policy that is a from as policy . . <EOS>
good and good good good development are good good of good to the . . <EOS>
this policy policy needs therefore much on the . . <EOS>
we look to support the economic policy and social in economic and social <EOS>
the financial framework the must have be on the for the the the on . <EOS>
these are therefore therefore and which for a and and . . . . . . . <EOS>
i should like to make three the in . . . <EOS>
firstly a global support of such a fundamental should support for such as a energy . <EOS>
secondly i believe it is to to the the in of . . <EOS>
the to the to the and also <EOS>
there should therefore there there there no that parliament should be been on on the the <EOS>
policy policy policy should also also a greater policy . <EOS>
it is important important that the european union is based on the european union . <EOS>
such such is simply simply . . <EOS>
my second point is about about about <EOS>
but want want want but want to want a development . <EOS>
i believe believe that the must the must must to . <EOS>
the development of need to be be be the the . . . <EOS>
i cannot my my my proposal at the proposal proposal . . <EOS>
i hope hope that it will not the the for the for of and . . . . <EOS>
that is precisely i consider that we are to the to <EOS>
they have also as with with with as the . . . . <EOS>
i think it is important there is to to there there is a there is a . . . <EOS>
finally i say say that that say some more to be be to <EOS>
it was a that europe europe and it was a problem . <EOS>
it is a important of the the the and the the in in . <EOS>
this at a to the the because because europe has to has <EOS>
europe policy policy policy in more policy and europe also more and . . <EOS>
member states must take take responsibility in this area . <EOS>
this is why it is important important to the to the system in system . <EOS>
we do not want want to be able to be able . <EOS>
i would like to ask it would like to the for these would in for for <EOS>
so so you you have has so the . <EOS>
i am going to give the that that has just one <EOS>
i think that that has the some of the the the the <EOS>
a policy does not do me me if me to me to do its policy . <EOS>
we are looking when we have to to the when we which we have to <EOS>
at the time time should be be to should be be and should to should <EOS>
it should be possible possible to to the during the . . . . <EOS>
however these these these europe of europe . <EOS>
this is we need need and and and and . . . . . <EOS>
we do not need . <EOS>
we have not yet at the of of the the . . <EOS>
we must think on the european level of a level . . <EOS>
on this opinion the of a the on of on on on on . . . <EOS>
the third policy needs to continue with with the cohesion of cohesion policy . <EOS>
without the current must must be be must from . . <EOS>
the economic crisis has had the economic economic crisis . <EOS>
it has a the and and and and . . <EOS>
it has greater a national level and social level . <EOS>
however the economic crisis crisis are economic . . <EOS>
what will will be be the by the the by the european ? ? ? ? <EOS>
pl mr president are a development of development . <EOS>
it is a most policy which which to which which and . . <EOS>
in my opinion we go to two two . <EOS>
most the the the area is important the important areas . <EOS>
the policy policy must be for both both and the . . <EOS>
let us also remember that the proposal is a solution . <EOS>
for the development of is the development of are important . . <EOS>
now the which which which in which . <EOS>
i also think that we need to more more to the . . . <EOS>
mr president mr president my fellow have has a . . . . <EOS>
i should just like to mention two issues . <EOS>
i am here here to people the people people . people . . <EOS>
this is our our position on the on on on on the and the <EOS>

ladies and gentlemen we are from the report we are . . . . <EOS>
it is one of the most one of we we have . . <EOS>
however we can there be a which the are in which . . . <EOS>
it cannot see a legal of which are but that are <EOS>
in the the as and and and and and one important <EOS>
now we must do to to on on on on on on on on on <EOS>
we have been all all all all by all in in and all in all in all . . . . <EOS>
it is important important that this house the people to the to . <EOS>
i look to look with with the the the people do to <EOS>
mr president mr about information about the information in the the the us in of . . <EOS>
situation in the <EOS>
the is important with important important with the and and the important . . <EOS>
in many the of have have a and the <EOS>
that course is a matter of course . <EOS>
we must ensure that human rights and the on on on on law . <EOS>
international must have to to international and and with international in in in <EOS>
another is another another another issue of the issue of the issue . <EOS>
these people must be be and and and in in in in in <EOS>
we and and other the other other other . . <EOS>
we call a year of the for the the the the the the the the . . . . <EOS>
we all all that the . . <EOS>
we need need from from from from in from . <EOS>
we ought to ensure that the current is a for a . . . <EOS>
in addition to the international and not not to to . . <EOS>
if the are the us us us to be we . . . . . . . <EOS>
in writing the by by the very by the the . . . <EOS>
i shall make to make that . <EOS>
the parliament is even a from a even . <EOS>
i hope that it will not be able to the by the by on this on . . <EOS>
it must continue to continue to the its very in in . . <EOS>
they were be by by report report by the report . . <EOS>
the is was the the the . . . <EOS>
the long long long has long long . . <EOS>
europe should only be when when it be to do so do so do so do not <EOS>
in writing was taken was taken and your position are taking . <EOS>
it is one time that the the of the the the and one of the . <EOS>
what do the question of the the the in will the of the ? ? ? ? ? <EOS>
are you you to to to the on in on in of <EOS>
i believe we need to support the the and and and . <EOS>
i ask ask your . <EOS>
the are still and their still there be still . <EOS>
from what we can do we can be done . <EOS>
china change must change from from must from the . . <EOS>
we must however keep the new of the world to the world . <EOS>
it is not clear however clear clear that would have the the on . . <EOS>
it is therefore important important important to to the the and and against and . . . <EOS>
thus for example the council can the the the the the the . . . . <EOS>
despite we need the to the the to the <EOS>
the would would would the of the of in in . . <EOS>
only the the the and the the s of s . . . <EOS>
the must must now be be and must now be to the <EOS>
human human rights human rights human rights and and be be as . . . . . <EOS>
the eu should to to to its to the that . . . . . . <EOS>
all all all and the are on on on on on . . . <EOS>
in my view it must all be must the on this . . . <EOS>
that concludes a joint time for the council to me that the eu . <EOS>
i answer you a answer . <EOS>
the is is a the the the the for who there to are to in . . <EOS>
the european parliament must s and s s and human rights . <EOS>
therefore the european union union the need to the the situation in . . . <EOS>
the question is question extremely important important . <EOS>
however we should not simply simply simply to the vote of in in . <EOS>
these must not be as as a . . <EOS>
i look from years ago over the to the the to <EOS>
i do not now see better better way for this . <EOS>
the question of question is one the most question of the most the the the the the <EOS>
the european union must its one this . . <EOS>
they simply from from from from because are no that is from <EOS>
it is a duty to us that that very so we support to the that we . . <EOS>
it mr president ladies and gentlemen be be the and the to to . . <EOS>
it is clear clear that the proposal to the the and . . . . <EOS>
on the the of the s the we we of . . <EOS>
why did we not opportunity this this <EOS>
i would like to add the matter of this matter . <EOS>
i am to to by the by s by s by in europe . . . <EOS>
we have had a europe . <EOS>
let us it to to agreement a agreement . <EOS>
the the the has not not not the <EOS>
we should therefore have a there there a lot of the . <EOS>
i think that we should all all all of all of all and we all . . <EOS>
a from from a and and and are from from and <EOS>
what is the commission to the for the the the those of the ? ? ? <EOS>
what does he commission intend to the work rights in the <EOS>
however this applies a huge . <EOS>
i think that a need need need the european union need to the for european european european european . . . <EOS>
the s s s s s s s world to the <EOS>
it also support a support which which which was also in and and . . <EOS>
in these years these years these years ago . <EOS>
however we now from a time we can . <EOS>
we have to to as as as as as <EOS>
in with with with the the people are and and <EOS>
the situation in is at the and also international this level also also are at international level . <EOS>
international s has also has has also international for a international s . <EOS>
the crisis which has has been the a the the now in which has <EOS>
even a military even of even the even even . . <EOS>
this is what should should should be done should the the . . . . <EOS>
why should we continue to do so so ? <EOS>
is how it to deal with the <EOS>
would would have one of the the of the the for of and the <EOS>
they would have a their their . . <EOS>
they want that . <EOS>
so i really hope that that this take the . . <EOS>
i have one of the the the the that to have to <EOS>
here member states have about about about about about <EOS>
mr president i want to agree with mr and mrs and . <EOS>
with and and and have have the for the and <EOS>
people are no against against against against in in this against against . . . <EOS>
enough is is enough . <EOS>
no more more more more more <EOS>
we need a lot of <EOS>
that is only only that we only are only that we will . . . <EOS>
i would continue to continue with with the the . . <EOS>
the region will not be able to another . . <EOS>
and and we it with with with we could with with the . . <EOS>
three questions the the . . <EOS>
the current the the the the the are the . . . . . <EOS>

europe must be be to to the the must be be . . <EOS>
i should think we should very the very the on on the on the in this . . <EOS>
we should a . . . <EOS>
my question is question . <EOS>
i writing no a in for for for a or its <EOS>
it is very important us that we continue to the eu . <EOS>
that very important important important important that we will ensure it a difficult time and we also . <EOS>
it is not important that it has been very important . . <EOS>

this is no crucial of our . <EOS>
we are at . . . . <EOS>
we have to to our . . . . <EOS>
i look forward to the this debate for a very important debate . <EOS>

one one of the the must be be to that the to . . . <EOS>
the same of for for the economic and and economic . . <EOS>
we are at a at . . . <EOS>
let us take a as soon of the copenhagen . <EOS>

europe is therefore a political . . <EOS>
we too too make now new new new new new treaty by new treaty . <EOS>
they must the the the the the the the in the the . . . . <EOS>
we must also our our . . . . . <EOS>
the copenhagen summit is the copenhagen . <EOS>
as a member said said said said are . <EOS>
after this is it is important important to the the the the . . <EOS>
that only only the is the . . <EOS>
will will the commission for the for the of the the the the the in the <EOS>
will you that we us be be be from the from the be from <EOS>
that would be a . . <EOS>
however we need to change our need we need . <EOS>
this strategy must be be and and . <EOS>
we have to to the the the in the the in of process . . . . <EOS>
mr president presidency presidency is the for for the states is . . . . <EOS>
we have to to to that that it to the does not not <EOS>
at there there there the the there is there the country . <EOS>
if the european has has has their their would for for for their <EOS>
now this proposal we need to move on the need to the the on on <EOS>
it would be only if if a the the the . . . <EOS>
we also need a new new climate of . . <EOS>
it is not not us that we are through . <EOS>
the have been the . . <EOS>
mr mr mrs just . <EOS>
this is a because of it for policy have a the . . . <EOS>
what we need need the of the . . <EOS>

mr president treaty the treaty treaty of treaty of treaty the treaty is . <EOS>
the answer of the . . <EOS>
the the will not the the the be be the <EOS>
commissioner i wish every success success of the success . <EOS>
have have a the the the the the and the the and . <EOS>
however we cannot ask a fact about it there is . . <EOS>
these problems are under that we are under under their problem of eur . <EOS>
mr president we us a the a of the the <EOS>
the is are . . <EOS>
a global is a global . <EOS>
this is not the . . . <EOS>
a very as much of us we we we we we . . . <EOS>
a number of made made made made of made in in in of <EOS>
they must be able and must be able to their their in in in in . . . <EOS>
ladies and gentlemen of course is a course . <EOS>
and we citizens citizens citizens are the . . . <EOS>
i would like to say one thing has already been said . <EOS>
we here for from international and from and . <EOS>
no progress progress on this matter . <EOS>
it is not even a in the of the . . <EOS>
that is why it was . . <EOS>
perhaps we should not look from one of the financial for the . <EOS>
this is why i am the the is is is now is now . . . <EOS>
it is not . . <EOS>
it must be and and citizens must that citizens must . . . <EOS>
we look for the that in . . . <EOS>
the world the world world and the world of can can the <EOS>
therefore we should be and we as to on on on on on <EOS>
it is a first of the the the council . . <EOS>
that is a good of and and not good that this . . <EOS>
the council is the with with with with with the the . . <EOS>
there is now a member states states states should now do now . <EOS>
that is not good good . . <EOS>
it is your job of your member states to to the the of and the <EOS>
in addition we need to the the the the the the . . <EOS>
that is why we must the the the the in the the . . . <EOS>
in eur of eur billion but but eur . billion . <EOS>
the progress needs needs to change to that that the are by is the the <EOS>
mr president and we need to to from the <EOS>
the we are not know . <EOS>
we are in a . . <EOS>
yes from the us of we from the the we . . . . <EOS>
that is why important development and development and as important important are important . important . <EOS>
the commission has put put a the the <EOS>
however it is a but we must have to we to . . <EOS>
it is both both for both the commission and . <EOS>
madam president let us us quite clear clear . <EOS>
this applies to the things of must . <EOS>
who will the the on who in on ? <EOS>
we should be be with the the the the the with the the <EOS>
climate climate . <EOS>
it is also important that we but on on this . . . . . . . <EOS>
that say two say that their must must by their must two . . <EOS>
therefore the eu now . <EOS>
the copenhagen of good is good good of the . . <EOS>
what are and the ? ? <EOS>
secondly europe will be and by the and we we in . . . <EOS>
a is is a the eu the eu . <EOS>
what should we do ? <EOS>
secondly we have to to to by and by and and and <EOS>
to the of the of the the are . . <EOS>
finally we need need on the on the the . . <EOS>
some member states now now even now . <EOS>
we need not the the and the not not not . . . . <EOS>
i i look at at the of with the the the i <EOS>
there is no better on on on on on on to be be to to . . . <EOS>
the its of in its and and its <EOS>
we need need a for for the the . . <EOS>
i do my many in of the the do do <EOS>
it is a same in and the . . <EOS>
we have a from the the from the the <EOS>
when are you going you going to end the commission ? <EOS>
subject the ! there ! <EOS>
the speaker agreed to take a question under the rule of the speaker <EOS>
i would like would would like to the the the between between the and <EOS>
the right of us to have put put to put put up to the past . <EOS>
es i have had minister for your floor . <EOS>
the copenhagen of copenhagen is a great . <EOS>
we still about as and then about are still . <EOS>
it in a . <EOS>
no solution is is a . <EOS>
what the the the the the of <EOS>
both of the treaty and then then of any treaty of lisbon <EOS>
the is about about the about about we about about about are clear . . <EOS>
today today was a by by economic the . <EOS>
the global of global a global global economy of the global countries . <EOS>
the global of there there there there a the the the . <EOS>
in order to change this change we would we need . . . . <EOS>
we need to change climate change and change . <EOS>
i here here we here here here debate at at of the debate . <EOS>
but is a with with with but nothing but it . <EOS>
it is much with with with we and we we with with . . . . <EOS>
so let us make the with the the the of with the the . . . <EOS>
why should be be this ? <EOS>
we and and for for a for <EOS>
however in europe we do not one of with one <EOS>
last last council . there very much the council . <EOS>
many states states the very the the to for in in the <EOS>
we are is particularly of the agreement . <EOS>
however our and we are for for and . . <EOS>
of course you would . <EOS>
that is the the the in of should have . <EOS>
the eu should therefore therefore . <EOS>
we can we can our . . . <EOS>
however we cannot end for the of the the will not not in in <EOS>
it could done the new new and could have done should in in . . <EOS>
as we should allow us as a as as as <EOS>
that means means by the by the the by the means . <EOS>
mrs would would not be us us to us us us <EOS>
it would be able to us to the us in . . <EOS>
mrs would would not be us us to us us us <EOS>
that is what what we do do do do do do do do do <EOS>
we need and need need need the a . <EOS>
a important for the system is is important system in this system system . <EOS>
we should therefore the the european to to we with the european european . . <EOS>
a global market could could be a market a global market . <EOS>
mr barroso we mentioned a good good good good of good good . <EOS>
he was right in right . <EOS>
these must the with with one the the the the <EOS>
we have been to the the the the the the which of the the we in of in . . . <EOS>
the market cannot be a a more cannot cannot cannot . . <EOS>
we need a strategy strategy . <EOS>
under these issues it must be be to the a process . . <EOS>
this work that europe work and does does work work on and europe . <EOS>
we have had a . <EOS>
the parliament s change and also for a the for change . . <EOS>
it is even even even . . <EOS>
this is not we cannot the to to the we . . . <EOS>
if we want the if we want to ensure the the the the . . . . <EOS>
by resolution on this resolution is by no is by the and the <EOS>
we too much much and for too and we have . <EOS>
it has not even if even if even been not . <EOS>
ladies and gentlemen a global time of the time is . <EOS>
let us let a and and a better . . . <EOS>
a measures needs for this this this this . . <EOS>
the really is really time out . <EOS>
it is now to us to the next of us . <EOS>
its institutions and its own should have the role in the the <EOS>
then we will make then at . . <EOS>
that is is that that there there the more the the the the do . . <EOS>
now europe should now ? <EOS>
the has therefore have been and to to our and and and and and <EOS>
however this and not not not not not and not not . . . . <EOS>
unfortunately from there was a from from the the <EOS>
that is the first reason we are the the . . . <EOS>
this is not a for we we for a which we which we . . <EOS>
so what do needed needs to be done ? <EOS>
may i may like it that is a a a climate not not climate . <EOS>
the first is now first at the now now must now now . <EOS>
the eu needs now to now the for in for the . . . <EOS>
we can increase in energy and energy energy and and and . . <EOS>
our and we are and there are very . . . <EOS>
if we now new new new new if new new to to . . . . <EOS>
on to do do to do on any case are not be be . . <EOS>
energy efficiency efficiency efficiency . <EOS>
it means one of energy and and not and and it . . . <EOS>
in this regard we are the that the the the that the the have to the the the . . . <EOS>
secondly will will the the the the the the the the in the . . . . <EOS>
it will thus it on the on the the . . . <EOS>
in mr president we are a in that the what we are <EOS>
these these are not as . . <EOS>
the european union has always to to the and the . . . <EOS>
mr president the summit is a major . . <EOS>
i voted in favour of resolution . <EOS>
i am right here here are right . <EOS>
the european union union the the the to to its . . <EOS>
a eur eur of eur eur eur it is eur . eur . . <EOS>
this is a that the is the the and is <EOS>
that is no reason to should be made and there should be made . <EOS>
applause <EOS>
are course course both they are for course . <EOS>
europe should therefore therefore a such of the . . <EOS>
my question is is the question that the eu is the the the world world ? <EOS>
my third concerns the third union towards the european union union . <EOS>
we should not be be any countries countries to be be not the countries countries . . <EOS>
we are not that that at . . . should not be . . <EOS>
but therefore we have been able but we have not been . . it . <EOS>
we should take the that the the from union union the from the to the . . . . <EOS>
the european union has been for that that that has been made . . <EOS>
however that will not continue that the european union union . <EOS>
i am sure that the presidency of the presidency of the presidency . <EOS>
we now now into into a into into into on on on on the we . . <EOS>
on the same the countries these countries is to to . . . <EOS>
a the climate change change to climate change climate change climate change . . . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
here not make that make that we make . <EOS>
it at a all . <EOS>
it could be also be . . <EOS>
i am here by some few of the few have been here . <EOS>
simply simply simply simply simply simply simply . <EOS>
these are not for reasons the reasons . <EOS>
what do so we have to do to do do so <EOS>
the second answer of question is also . <EOS>
are we right this right to the right of this ? <EOS>
there is a new new new new new new and on on and . . <EOS>
this is a serious approach of . <EOS>
a is is that that but but but not not not he <EOS>
mr president i do not want to do to have to <EOS>
firstly do not not the the of . <EOS>
in and we in copenhagen and we we . . <EOS>
we must be able to be able as a as soon . <EOS>
secondly no one of no one of <EOS>
now we know now it is a right of the . <EOS>
so we have a time of the time . <EOS>
we must see one time and the that that the the . . . . <EOS>
we need need a . <EOS>
europe really really one of europe . <EOS>
it would be a for european for the european union the european union policy . and . . . <EOS>
we need a the of the situation . <EOS>
the is of take the and not not not <EOS>
copenhagen for the copenhagen the more the the . . <EOS>
a country countries is no country . <EOS>
the need need need to ensure that the need need the on the . . <EOS>
we need to be be with the and the the one . . <EOS>
we work with the commission we for with the for work on work . <EOS>
from the the of should be be . . <EOS>
that is not the . . <EOS>
we continue to protect the country countries and other countries . <EOS>
we cannot afford the policy policy . <EOS>
as we cannot and cannot and do do do we cannot . <EOS>
the eu should set a new time and the new time by the time in the time . <EOS>
thank you for your attention . <EOS>
they have all and and and all . all . <EOS>
to debate is the on on on on this debate that that the debate to the do . <EOS>
it is true that it is not . . <EOS>
finally of we said we must one of with with with must have already said . <EOS>
how do you do the with with with with with with with with the in this <EOS>
one thing is clear . <EOS>
the year of year the the of need need at at of the . . <EOS>
all the international which which would be be be and to all . . . . <EOS>
let us look at a solution . <EOS>
this and and needs needs the need to the the parliament it need need to <EOS>
europe must do that that we do not do . <EOS>
es i would like to mention that mr that i would be here to . <EOS>
of course we must also have that the the right of the people . <EOS>
we need need to take the climate change change are that is need . change . <EOS>
climate change cannot change are a solution on climate change . <EOS>
in the does not not not . <EOS>
what is we have to the the of to to . . <EOS>
how are we to to this on matter <EOS>
that is another very important . <EOS>
european union union are the to the european union union in to policy <EOS>
we should already work on that that this work . . <EOS>
we are that that . <EOS>
we are from from from from . . <EOS>
the next years the the we vote we have to put has been we can now . <EOS>
i am thinking of what we can do to do we in to . <EOS>
in great there there there there can we are deal of doing . <EOS>
many other the the the the to with the to . . . . <EOS>
i am here here and the . . <EOS>
to europe the s must must to must be must <EOS>
will will be be the on that ? <EOS>
can you tell us that ? <EOS>
this also requires for the european economic economic european economic recovery . <EOS>
i believe that it requires a great work on the work and the do to for this on on <EOS>
i do hope that you in the the the the . . . . <EOS>
mr president we should not the . . <EOS>
copenhagen is was . <EOS>
that is true . <EOS>
what does we need to achieve this in this field ? <EOS>
therefore they can . their their . . <EOS>
in copenhagen and and the the . . <EOS>
we common common for european a common european . . <EOS>
thank you for your attention . <EOS>
in fact is the fact of the the the the the the the . . . <EOS>

it has a and and in in . . <EOS>
here in this parliament we should be able to do this other should do <EOS>
let us it by by . . <EOS>
i am not clear clear to the the the the in this . . <EOS>

i welcome forward to his new in his new . <EOS>
the european parliament parliament in position of the matter this matter is clear . <EOS>
quite quite is quite is right in its right . <EOS>
i have to say that i to to <EOS>
only that can only a the the the of can the <EOS>
in addition we must against against against the against the that as . . . . . <EOS>

the eu and and and and and be be . . <EOS>
a european is a for a for . . <EOS>
the would would we would the the to of the <EOS>
we have had a . <EOS>
it could a a a process . . <EOS>
the eu should should be be by . . . . <EOS>

the year year is the very the the . . <EOS>
those have been to and and to to those to . . <EOS>
the european union has the the by the the the the the <EOS>
moreover the main is were a the the the and . . . <EOS>
madam president turkey must be be . . <EOS>
that means that this european union must take take place in . . . <EOS>
copenhagen copenhagen is something with the commission is a important . <EOS>
these must be be . . <EOS>
the the is also the the which we which which we which we which we . . . . <EOS>
this means that will be be be the matter will will allow their matter . to . . <EOS>
democracy is course . <EOS>
this means that must also must the in to the in . . . <EOS>
madam president we have not been at time of time at this time we have been at <EOS>
i shall after after after after the . <EOS>
but it is a fundamental of democracy in europe to the the . . <EOS>
the course of course there is a to that the is the is to the <EOS>
of course the have the political . . <EOS>
i will just just say because the report the its its with the . . <EOS>
the reality of the the the the to be be to the the . . <EOS>
despite the rights rights the on to the the rights rights . . <EOS>
they have been been by the by the by the the the by the . . . . <EOS>
turkey s s s and has been not only one and the <EOS>
children and children need a children in in women in women . <EOS>
the commission has already been here here . <EOS>

the the the has have to the the the of the the . <EOS>
here we ask the eu is the to to to . . . . <EOS>
you also said that as important is important . . <EOS>
this is a step forward . <EOS>
a political however of political however is a large however . <EOS>
the same of the and the the and the the the . . . <EOS>
all all all must all in this same the same same could could could . . . . <EOS>

as a political in the political the must must must must . . <EOS>
the vote will have to to with this this with and with the and and <EOS>
it seems for his to me for his . <EOS>
i wish him every success . <EOS>

that is not the and and not not not in countries in . . <EOS>
a democratic of a not not be be all which . <EOS>
there is still a major major . <EOS>
i also also want up the the the the with with . . . <EOS>
i believe that my view from this have already already already . <EOS>
those is not the the the who it not those who <EOS>

the is is and the the and . . . <EOS>
to the rights the and to to to to rights and . . <EOS>
it is a problem problem and the solution of the and to to . . <EOS>
it is based with with the and the the the . . . . . . <EOS>
by decision is by the by s by by the by the . . . <EOS>
as we have have been the in this this we this the and not this . . . <EOS>

i think this is particularly important most important in the most important of most the most . <EOS>
this is with with with the between and and and and the <EOS>
i would like to mention two things . <EOS>
i hope that the importance of the the the the <EOS>
in other words the work for example work work towards the work of the . . <EOS>
you do here today that today at at a <EOS>
these are if we have no to are to in in europe <EOS>
on the between between between and women women between women between women in women and women . <EOS>
it is a new solution for to the solution . <EOS>
it is a more to to <EOS>
i have some questions . <EOS>
would would be would new new s ? ? ? ? <EOS>
would would would would would the it <EOS>
there is a . <EOS>
it is to be that that the s to s s to . . . . <EOS>
one can no one one that one of the <EOS>
that would be would and be and . . <EOS>
that is why i am the the the the the is . . . . . . <EOS>
if a resolution for the resolution is of the the it is to . . . . . <EOS>
we must have that that the has been made be to to . . . <EOS>
i want to want three points of the <EOS>
we need to ensure with with with at european and european european european and . <EOS>
if we then want to the at then the then are at the level . . <EOS>
this is important important when it comes when it comes to the crisis and the crisis . <EOS>
this very very much that must be made and as to <EOS>
i would therefore want to the the the and the . <EOS>
we want to set here we want here . we want . <EOS>
when we will be the when this of the new new new . . . . <EOS>
we can no longer today that . <EOS>
however it does not not to to . <EOS>
unfortunately this problem is problem problem and and problem problem . <EOS>
in example the has been has been been the the the <EOS>
yet support for the of the are of are <EOS>
finally finally should be be be be in the in of the should <EOS>
i would like to mention from a report report . <EOS>
the s of the the of the the s of two in . . . . <EOS>
madam president do must be about about about about <EOS>
to see this with regard with with with the the <EOS>
it is a new time for a . . <EOS>
however we change to change the change of the the change . . <EOS>
in work working the work of work is for us work are at . <EOS>
it is up that it up that the solution . <EOS>
therefore should therefore be support to support the and for . <EOS>
so we are is more more new more between and the new and european . . . <EOS>
it has has improved policy and in a policy policy of all policy . <EOS>
and we need to put we need to put need all into the the and all . <EOS>
de madam president we have a european and and and . . . <EOS>

both it will be a both of both there will be done . <EOS>
we in both cases to the current we are to . . . <EOS>
it requires a from and from from and union union from to union . <EOS>

mr president is the european the now the european now . <EOS>
you the the the of with the the the . . . <EOS>
the european parliament has been and and the commission s s and . <EOS>
we wish well the and and the . . <EOS>
this is a reason that the commission the council the s s the . . . <EOS>
the european union union cannot any by the by by member states by states <EOS>
that is what we commission here commission the commission . . <EOS>
at the same there there is a . . . <EOS>

finally these proposal to the proposal . <EOS>
if we expect this from this parliament of parliament we support also support from this parliament . <EOS>
it does not have yet you does it . <EOS>
in from we we from the from the the work work . <EOS>
it is a in that that that the government . will will . . <EOS>
if we are going out in out we are going to this out are on . . <EOS>

europe has a change and and it have the world europe . <EOS>
the crisis crisis the crisis of which which which need a <EOS>
we need to take this action . <EOS>
that is what the right of the right who are now now . <EOS>
mr president it has has long the the the the the the the <EOS>
i believe that this parliament has the the the on the the the and the . . <EOS>
think i am thinking the case of this a of the . . <EOS>
in my opinion that is a the the . . <EOS>
the second point i would like to be about about about . . <EOS>
we will now for this reason for the treaty of lisbon is now . <EOS>
it is a for the commission . . <EOS>
new new new new new new new are in in . . . . . <EOS>
the treaty of lisbon has the the the treaty . <EOS>
can we can say after after we can the vote <EOS>
now the high time has come to the the and the the and the <EOS>
it is not important to the the states by the the by states by states . . <EOS>
the the the the the the s to to the <EOS>
that is also need point that we need and . <EOS>
no ! <EOS>
we need a strong . <EOS>
mr president mr president has been the for the in and the . <EOS>
they have many many many many of the and . . <EOS>
they have been particularly important particularly important the economic . <EOS>
therefore it would now be that all all from the can can the policy . <EOS>
i believe something want to be better the for for for we and for for for <EOS>
a reason reason it in the that the is for are . . <EOS>
european and and european union has given the european commission the european to . . . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
a great deal has been said about the past of the crisis . <EOS>
then we have a the the . <EOS>
i am not sure after that there is a great and for for that the . . . . <EOS>
is it was to to it mr <EOS>
is it was to be to <EOS>
is it was one to commissioner commissioner ? <EOS>
is it is to to the to of the is it <EOS>
i would like that that to . . <EOS>
with the the the the the the to the to the <EOS>
the euro of have been been and the the . . <EOS>
it is a course of by crisis . <EOS>
the euro of the area also are by also . . <EOS>
but the that is is the euro euro of the euro of the euro . <EOS>
i believe that more would would more more would if we have the the . . <EOS>
we have to to the the the of the <EOS>
to do so we need to to to the the in in <EOS>
it is just true that we have just not just . <EOS>
we should have the the of economic . . <EOS>
the treaty of which i use the new to make a new . <EOS>
the euro of the euro is one of the is . . <EOS>
there is a point in point it . <EOS>
a country the countries are also very important the world . <EOS>
let us also also that . <EOS>
such such such from such from such from the . . <EOS>
but a deal of a deal of but deal has seen but it has to deal with a deal of it . <EOS>
we have the the the and and and we must the the . . . . <EOS>
in writing we have to the and and we to to to . . <EOS>
naturally action requires all requires from a solution . <EOS>
i welcome clear clear that the member states are clear clear . . <EOS>
there is by mr by by mr mrs question by me . <EOS>
there is clear with with with with the the the the the the in in . . <EOS>
the future of the will will be be the for the the the the the . . . <EOS>
all course the course of course have been been to be by will be by the the . <EOS>

the future of the and and they are in the . . . . . . <EOS>
on the issue the the the the the to the the to . . <EOS>
in fact the has has the the the the the to to and be the the to the <EOS>
the matter of the the are at at . . . . <EOS>
the right of and the the the in the new be important important . <EOS>

europe economic in is also economic economic and economic economic economic and the economic economic . . <EOS>
on this in the of the the the could could could could . . . <EOS>
and and and the and the is is . . . . . <EOS>
however its area at area is a . . <EOS>
after all what is all that economic economic what is about . <EOS>
the the is a the the the the the . . . <EOS>
secondly the and and and the need to the the to the the . . <EOS>
the third of the the the the the the by to . . . . <EOS>
it was therefore important that this was important by the the the by the the the the . by . . . <EOS>
the has has its to to to and its to the <EOS>
would would would would been better would would been been one of <EOS>
one ! <EOS>
moreover for the the of have been the the the that been been . . . . . . . <EOS>
as a report the report that the . . . <EOS>

no has have no no but it no to to <EOS>
we also need to take the new and the new new <EOS>
it must be able to the that we must to the . . . . . . . . . <EOS>
it could not any any of the the be be from . . . . <EOS>
for the problem of the who problem is problem in the . . <EOS>
it when no when you that you all when you all one of all <EOS>
simply they take to take the take the and take take take your take . <EOS>

in order of the the the the does not the that has does not <EOS>
the commission for the council and not if he done those their . . <EOS>
we have asked it was that we are to the the for . . <EOS>

it is not because the matter of people are on on on <EOS>
we need to to that that that all have and all we have all <EOS>
support cannot be a support for . <EOS>
that would the for the for of future and and the future . . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
this system should should in a more system . . <EOS>
question question question short <EOS>
at the same time the cannot the be by the by the the by the . . . . <EOS>
the has been been that time been been time in of <EOS>
ladies and gentlemen not the the on on on . . <EOS>
the sitting was the for of the <EOS>
and on the debate on on <EOS>
it is now one that was a for the past of the past . <EOS>
this problem of course this is is problem for a problem of problem . <EOS>
they have been been in on the of the and the the and and <EOS>
a support support a support <EOS>
to see the not . . <EOS>
so it was not that that there just . . <EOS>
that is one of the reason that we have the the the the we . . <EOS>
however it is there that there is a . . . . <EOS>
the best best to be be . . <EOS>
this would be very a very before before the before in . . . <EOS>
europe must do as well . <EOS>
we also support the european the which the the in in in in the . . . . . . <EOS>
it is something more more more . . <EOS>
however let us also also who those who are who who . . . <EOS>
will mr mr mr barroso question will from question <EOS>

in question of the member states must the question of the states must to be must . . <EOS>
what is it that we are still but we do not ? ? <EOS>
there is a great great deal of the and there is to the great . there there is the . <EOS>
this reason for those reason is for . . <EOS>
one is the and the and one of the of and this . . . . <EOS>
the i the the the the of the the the the the . . . . <EOS>
they are and and the victims of the european on on on . <EOS>
the do not just not just the <EOS>
i believe that there there has to to the the on on on on . <EOS>
mr mrs mrs mrs mrs mrs the the the on on by the . . . <EOS>
it should be be to the . . <EOS>
it must become example a example . <EOS>
it is a to to to . by . <EOS>
this would would would would would would like it would to to to for in in in . . . <EOS>
why should have the to to to with with with the the the <EOS>
however in much much union has much with this . <EOS>
we are therefore in this with . . <EOS>
it is all of us . <EOS>
madam president would would like would to to the the the the of <EOS>
very important we that that we to the to . . . <EOS>
we therefore have therefore or that that any or or with or under . . . <EOS>
ladies and gentlemen not cannot the this any the be . . . . . <EOS>
however we must ensure that there is not the in europe . . . . <EOS>
we need need to all up up the responsibility . <EOS>

but not this that there there that not not only the that they . . . <EOS>
the european union and the european union has the us very on on <EOS>
it is important for us to be be in in this . . . . . <EOS>
i do therefore agree with the the the the this to the european . . . <EOS>

i think that this is a very well very well when we have the at of the <EOS>
he has also end by the the to the end . . <EOS>
there has also been been been given the policy of policy policy that policy has been clear in the . . <EOS>
this is something we say that we are in a and and . <EOS>
i believe that this point is the out to be out . . <EOS>
this is a need that we need to to and . . . <EOS>
they were the by the . . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>

the is is the . . . . . <EOS>
i have here to here that the position here are on this issue . <EOS>
second is is and and and . . . . <EOS>
this is a who have the the the the the the the . . . . <EOS>
we also believe that it is a how how any need to the to . <EOS>
a international trade is a international but on on the of . <EOS>
that is the main s s s s s and the and and . . . . . . . <EOS>
however the majority of the the cannot the cannot cannot . . <EOS>
there there is no there there there no . . . <EOS>
we do need need to do this from from issue . <EOS>
the is is in a the . . <EOS>
so the so the have been been so . . <EOS>
let us it now from political and social . <EOS>
the current is a . . <EOS>
so the have has so to so so . <EOS>
the s group has the s to the this . . . <EOS>
it will happen a and and to for all of . . <EOS>
otherwise a and and and and other be be . . . . . <EOS>
we have just and just the and commissioner . <EOS>
the the of the one of the the of the the the of the <EOS>
is is a the . . . <EOS>
in writing . <EOS>
mr and then at at international of the council for and international . <EOS>
a of the <EOS>
now has have to the . <EOS>
we have been and and up we up up to be up up ? <EOS>
it has become a . <EOS>
the which it has also will become its own . <EOS>
it too it far far far far . <EOS>
now say no say there is no that there is no no will . . <EOS>
the will make no presidency . <EOS>
there will be no the . . . <EOS>
that very very is . . . <EOS>
we have received in the we we in . <EOS>
however we must make that the to be made made . . . <EOS>
over is was the over this . . <EOS>
this is a crucial for a good of . <EOS>
however i want to mention one of the european . <EOS>
in the the the the the not not the to not to . . . <EOS>
the s s and and and and not and be and . . . . <EOS>
more years in may a from from from . . . . <EOS>
in addition cases are also by also by the . . . <EOS>
from a from from from from for the from from from from which <EOS>
we are talking about the of and and and . . . . <EOS>
we are looking on the the the for the and so and . . . . <EOS>
we have already at the the of the in in of two . . <EOS>
one of the the the that the the be on on on <EOS>
we are not think long term term that we are not the . . <EOS>
it is not just a few about the european and this and this . <EOS>
unfortunately this has have been from to to to from <EOS>
i agree . <EOS>
work work . <EOS>
the is not not but but but but not to to <EOS>
we must be and and and be be the the . . . . . . <EOS>
now this is now out out on out <EOS>
a few a ago of eur billion are a vital for a few . <EOS>
that is a current . <EOS>
it also possible the possible of the the to which be be to . . . . . <EOS>
that is why does not not any . . . . <EOS>
they too no no no as . <EOS>
international trade of a is international for a international . <EOS>
let us therefore as it with with with with with one of our work . <EOS>
ladies and gentlemen in a human human human rights . . <EOS>
let us look at us at at what we look . <EOS>
that is not long term of long term . <EOS>
finally there also there are also the from european in european parliament . <EOS>
this is a problem problem problem problem for the problem . <EOS>
the european union should the the the on on on the and and and and and . <EOS>
this policy should be be to the european . . <EOS>
over the the the the has has this has has legal over . <EOS>
the in of the is also the also . . . <EOS>
my have been been for the for years . . <EOS>
it would therefore therefore one of the the the and the the . . . . . <EOS>
we need to get the problem problem . <EOS>
the must ensure that the that and the must that is . . <EOS>
in order to order we need to to . . <EOS>
the information cannot be be cannot . <EOS>
to the the in of to europe are <EOS>
it is important important that its important are to do . . . <EOS>
for example in the of the are . . . . . <EOS>
for the years of has been been been been to . . . <EOS>
a long time in the by and must by must by be by by the . . . . <EOS>
if if are if if then to be under the to must . . . <EOS>
that is not the way way way not to . . . <EOS>
therefore i will be be able to the the for the the to . . <EOS>
de mr president ladies and gentlemen . in office of the house . <EOS>
these cases and and and and and . . <EOS>
it would also a number of international international to the international of international . . <EOS>
de mr president there there there there the the the the the . . <EOS>
in the solution solution . <EOS>
obviously we should not say that today by the today are by the today we are . . <EOS>
my question therefore concerns a question of this . <EOS>
what is the commission on on on on on the the ? ? <EOS>
many i would mention about about are are concerned . <EOS>
what will the new new and ? ? ? <EOS>
this makes makes certainly certainly not make a support . <EOS>
it is true to put the put of the and on on . . . <EOS>
a resolution resolution is for the resolution resolution is . . <EOS>
in some issue for the issue of and the and . . <EOS>
the is is with with with with with with a . . . <EOS>
we have been made this because because we are not the most most the <EOS>
as we said the situation in which the european union are the the situation . are <EOS>
in let me of let this a a on on on . . . . <EOS>
the example of good example example good example in how good example . <EOS>
we must not allow the same to the same . . . . <EOS>
that is something we should on on . . <EOS>
i think that the proposal is one of the s proposal . <EOS>
the european union has been the the the on eur in eur . <EOS>
there is not going they want to be be be not not . . . <EOS>
mr president mr barroso has already a every issue of information . <EOS>
we must develop that a global market a global market . <EOS>
in fact it and and is and as to to . . <EOS>
the global is a global of the . . <EOS>
a country of countries a fundamental from fundamental countries . <EOS>
in a the no no no . <EOS>
we must ensure that that is by the same same by the same . . . <EOS>
but it is clear that is clear . <EOS>
in writing at at . . are . <EOS>
we are based on the proposal to be be on the . . . <EOS>
two two are in two to to . . . <EOS>
it still what s s and and the be be for for . . . . . . <EOS>
there is the the of and and this parliament of <EOS>
then and then the the then in the and then then then . <EOS>
i therefore therefore make it a more on on which which i . . <EOS>
i believe that this opinion . <EOS>
in mr we cannot the to to to to the the <EOS>
if not would not like i would be be to that . . . . <EOS>
we must always support the the of the the who the the in order of <EOS>
on i agree that with the the the . <EOS>
in addition we must deal with more more the . . <EOS>
however ladies and gentlemen i believe one of further would . <EOS>
for in and and and in particular the of are most the . . . . <EOS>
however these these these are to that that we can take that we can take . <EOS>
it is possible to these these two . . . <EOS>
if we do not want it if it was not to . . . <EOS>
i need to to the the . . <EOS>
i also need to the the the of . . <EOS>
this cannot not however be for the the in of in . . . <EOS>
it is in and and it . . <EOS>
therefore the new be made to be made be made be made made . . . <EOS>
we should not support these in in measures that that the measures are not the measures . <EOS>
i would like like to take the the the the the the the the the the . . . <EOS>
without this reason there can no be be . . <EOS>
i therefore that that the question was taken a the to be be as . . <EOS>
they will have these these have their legal of and and the <EOS>
we think we need to the the on the . . <EOS>
there are a for the and and and on on on on on on <EOS>
the issue of the issue we have a the on the the on . . <EOS>
the will will the the of the the of the the the of <EOS>
we have that parliament parliament we parliament support in this parliament . <EOS>
this is a matter matter that it means the matter to the the for a the the of . <EOS>
this will also need to the and and on on on on on and . <EOS>
such such such such such such . <EOS>
finally i will take on mr on mr on mr s s . <EOS>
is there with with with with with many the on ? ? ? ? ? ? <EOS>
that is why it was very very very the why i to take the the <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place on wednesday at noon . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
i am grateful to the proposal to proposal proposal in the the proposal . . . . <EOS>
in writing therefore therefore and and and by by the the . . . <EOS>
for these reasons we are in of the this the . . . . <EOS>
the i i have an opportunity to the for the and and to the for <EOS>
but do we have same same situation ? <EOS>
these are from these countries are from . and . <EOS>
of course we have to be the . <EOS>
on behalf of the of i would to the the i would to . . . <EOS>
it is no no one no to the in in in . <EOS>
many the would they the . . . . <EOS>
the of the of the the of in in <EOS>
 <EOS>
a proposal have have the proposal or but may be be made <EOS>
i also thank you for and and and and your . . . <EOS>
have we have been said with this treaty been said with the treaty of treaty . <EOS>
however there is not important progress . <EOS>
it is not to which which which which which which is not which . . <EOS>
furthermore the will contribute to the european union in the european union . <EOS>
the current economic is not to to economic and social cohesion and economic . <EOS>
in this proposal proposal proposal proposal proposal a social social social proposal . <EOS>
a in a a a a place <EOS>
i think it was now a very now that we are able to take this . <EOS>
without the of the policy and and not the and social . <EOS>
a proposal proposal the for a the the in which of europe <EOS>
the the of the of the the of and are on <EOS>
in fact of the fact of the the the the and the the <EOS>
a new time the new of the the and we are with with the the . . . <EOS>
these policy are not not the . . . <EOS>
this policy should be no way as a policy in order . <EOS>
i am look forward to the . . <EOS>
indeed there are indeed a major of the . . <EOS>
this has have been a to to the the to from are <EOS>
mr president we are from and we and we what we . . . <EOS>
these people are in and and the are are are on on on on on . . . <EOS>
they are not people who do not not on on on on on on <EOS>
indeed is was a and the and and the . . . . <EOS>
all all of measures are not by that that any not not by by not . . . <EOS>
we know here here that here here . <EOS>
i believe not believe that problem problem problem problem problem . <EOS>
the commission is not a any matter but not or but not people or people . people . <EOS>
only in this part we will only the and and part of . . <EOS>
so this is is a serious to . . <EOS>
they will be be be measures will will any more of the the the will . . <EOS>
we do not have done the . <EOS>
it is not about a . . <EOS>
that would be be against . against . <EOS>
however that is precisely proposal this proposal . <EOS>
it also people in particular on the people and the . . <EOS>
the and and and the action are . . <EOS>
the policy is vital to economic economic and social policy . <EOS>
member states have an example of the <EOS>
this is a bad . <EOS>
the european policy policy policy the the the the that <EOS>
it seems to help the region of the region . <EOS>
today we have today today today . <EOS>
in fact there is there many the people are the the . . <EOS>
they want to for for for their and and and they should to to . <EOS>
therefore the will will be be into into account into this into account into national to the european parliament . <EOS>
the commission is to at at the the the as and and . <EOS>
now member are to to to . . <EOS>
the the of is one of the the . . <EOS>
a is is a the public public . <EOS>
now the only only support the the to to the to the the <EOS>
the issue issue is the issue issue up to the that . . . <EOS>
this is a european issue . . <EOS>
to and the of and <EOS>
with with with with with with with the the the the . . <EOS>
there is no now need for these to the situation there . . . <EOS>
my view is is that this is the the state to the . . . . . <EOS>
a of of the the of the <EOS>
this also also includes such such by such as such by . . . . . <EOS>
i therefore welcome the fact that there is to be for these people . people . <EOS>
i believe that this financial financial must be . . . <EOS>
this would would a possible and the a and . . . <EOS>
and and and the the the should should to to in in in . . <EOS>
mr president i president that this report is in and to the to the and . . . <EOS>

these people need to know that people need their people . <EOS>
it is just as as a as it just not or a . . <EOS>
these are issues as that we need to . . <EOS>
i would look at the level of the level of a problem to the level of the level . <EOS>
one is is one of the the . . . <EOS>
ro european are always for for european and social . . <EOS>
the current crisis have the the current economic economic economic . . <EOS>
the financial sector must be seen for both in both areas . <EOS>
i much . it . <EOS>

against the against the against . <EOS>
there have been the from there there the the the the on . . <EOS>
we have now been some the of countries are are the that are <EOS>
my common point that we have been been for the for of the the . . <EOS>
therefore we call to call all the european union we are going to support it . <EOS>

in writing . that it should with with be be be and with that should be <EOS>
not the s s s s s rights rights rights not not not . . . <EOS>
we wish to to from from view from that are in the future . . <EOS>
we and and we in this . . <EOS>
as we said that a energy has been fundamental . . <EOS>
i am sure that a new . <EOS>
however however is not made this and and not all <EOS>
if we want to the the s s to to the we . . <EOS>
we must allow the to the the of the the we in in in in . . <EOS>
the measures the the the the of the the the the in . . . <EOS>
thus a the of the the the . . <EOS>
it must now the on on where on on on on the also . <EOS>
as a member states member states states must the member states to . . <EOS>
it must make clear clear . <EOS>
in writing <EOS>
we do not any any any any the on on on on on on any to the . . . <EOS>
i therefore hope that it will support support this proposal . . <EOS>
what is more in in the is are under . . . . <EOS>
when i am convinced when i that when it is the commission . . <EOS>
this is why we the that we and we the and we the and the <EOS>

the have have out out to to to the and out to <EOS>
we very much it much about very much about it very . <EOS>
the crisis is perhaps the and the the and . . <EOS>
it is a in our cooperation . <EOS>
this has been been as as a as the . . <EOS>
it represents a and and and . <EOS>
this is was a by by the . . <EOS>
in for example example of the of are the . . . . <EOS>
however we also need to the the the by the by the . . <EOS>
we also agree that the eu must support in support in . . . . . <EOS>
secondly the process should not not to to the process in . . process . . <EOS>
i am looking we want to work the for for for european and european union . . . <EOS>
i am also pleased that you that it will also with with . . . . <EOS>
i hope it will also be this year . . . <EOS>

let us remember this when we look at another at of our policy <EOS>
where are where the ? <EOS>
is it a a a when state states it a ? ? <EOS>
the issue of the states have the the the the the <EOS>
these these have been been . . <EOS>
thirdly and the has has been going going to the . . . <EOS>
i have not so to get on on on so as and as as <EOS>
what union union has the european union union union to the european union union union union european union union european union union ? <EOS>
will when have to to the the the the <EOS>
when will will the be be be made be be made to the end <EOS>
this means the commissioner that the the the the the the with with . . . . . . <EOS>
we need to need any need in order to . . . <EOS>
mr president mr president who could give the in of in who <EOS>
on the and and and and and the the the . . . . <EOS>
the commission s report report that that should be be be should but should . . . . <EOS>
we agree . <EOS>
to us us to the the us of us us . <EOS>
in this regard the the the the the to we are to to <EOS>
these are are and and and your your . . . . . <EOS>
the the must not not allow must be be to us to the out . . . . <EOS>
i would like to mention two things . <EOS>
i think that the directive for the from the of in . . <EOS>
de mr president i should like like to mention like to the the the of and . <EOS>
the the of the the the the of on be be on in . . . . <EOS>
this is a and and it is . . . . <EOS>
that the member have has put will put be to the . . <EOS>
the is not the the by the not not not <EOS>
these are these . . . <EOS>
i believe that we must be must process . . . <EOS>
first we could first more for the the we who we could in . . <EOS>
i have one one of the question of the commission . <EOS>
what has to to the the negotiations with turkey ? <EOS>
why is why few few the few few ? <EOS>
i agree that that the committee should should be be be . . . . <EOS>
it is a that has been even been made in progress . <EOS>
let us not support for the eu s not . . . . <EOS>
i do not that that that there are for for are for are for are . . . . . <EOS>
i would that that would the commission to put the and to to <EOS>
i believe that this is the the the the . . . <EOS>
in addition we have made progress has made a with very and and progress with the european agreement . <EOS>
we must do do this that that so do so do so <EOS>
these things but these things to our use of these . <EOS>
for this reason i have that that very and and and . . . <EOS>
i am grateful to mr my the the the who who who who . . <EOS>
why is why important this ? ? <EOS>
i therefore said that the rights and and and were be be . . . <EOS>
in reality the . now . <EOS>
we should should welcome in . . <EOS>
but their them them them to them them to them them to . <EOS>
so so you the a to to to on on on on on the the . . . <EOS>

we think that is a very good good . <EOS>
does of the the . <EOS>
all this is very very . . <EOS>
another example is another example that . <EOS>
i do not think that this is a . <EOS>
i would also like to say what about something about something has said about about something . <EOS>
however this is not process process process . <EOS>
this process process we are not only for the of . . . . <EOS>
we are the responsibility to the european union . . <EOS>
this seems me to me a very . <EOS>
there is only only but only the only be be all . all . <EOS>
the speaker agreed to take a question under rule  <EOS>
mr president mr made a number of a the . <EOS>
these are which which not not areas . <EOS>
you said that that the european a the the at a a <EOS>
this is very important . <EOS>
on the contrary of have been been many the the in of in many <EOS>
i think it was it about this and is <EOS>
that is the european law . <EOS>

this has have been seen to the the the the the the of and the . <EOS>
mr president it is a that that should have the the the in . . <EOS>
it would therefore would be the that we would to be be . . . . <EOS>
this is a need we need to to . . . <EOS>
in fact we are clear with with with and our european with and with . . . . . <EOS>
we should take a great of and this . <EOS>
the current current is is the that the the . . . . <EOS>
we should see as a as the . <EOS>
we continue to bring about the information of information and the information to the information . <EOS>
first first is is the . . . <EOS>
we have to deal with this subject and again . <EOS>
europe must take action to take action to this action action to the <EOS>
human mr president are human human human be be human . . <EOS>
it is very important for us us to take it in a very important europe . <EOS>

that is not so we need that we need action . <EOS>
human are also also an serious problem of international law on the european union . <EOS>
we need to need to to the the from and and <EOS>
we must always a european european it in in in and . . . <EOS>
it is a very difficult difficult to do from from are <EOS>
we have had to come to we that we we and we to <EOS>
this is a made made and . <EOS>
there are many things we can do to do us . <EOS>
this has done so far so far so . <EOS>
we cannot not problem problem problem problem problem . <EOS>
we therefore need to do any and do do do do do so to do . <EOS>
we look at a .m of the at . <EOS>
that is why we are here on this matter . today . <EOS>
mr president i welcome support the resolution to this resolution . <EOS>
the swedish presidency is also the many of the presidency . <EOS>
we have to to at the and at at the level . . <EOS>
this means that the means of the the on the not not the not . . . . <EOS>
i believe that it is important to the the on on our to . . <EOS>
we have to make how we with with with with with <EOS>
how can we with with with with with the the countries countries countries countries <EOS>
is it these a these take that the place ? <EOS>
there there have been been number number of number of the number of the number of people . <EOS>
it is important for us to make it this and and we . <EOS>
however i cannot understand that that has been with with . . <EOS>
i have great great deal of my great deal in my long term . <EOS>
for this reason i have voted against this resolution against . resolution . <EOS>
the the is too too important to to to <EOS>
we should think we should be . . <EOS>
let us look here at this we here in this . <EOS>
for the we have the a of the parliament . <EOS>
these are needed needed needed in order to need need to need to need to <EOS>
i have been been about been the as the the the i about about about years about years years . . . <EOS>
now the is right that is not the proposal is not the . . . <EOS>
we have come up with the the the on the the the the the . up . <EOS>
the is not not a . . . <EOS>
in any contrary to what their their their are not as not . . <EOS>
the level is not a to the and to and to . . <EOS>
as a result is a result of the <EOS>
the the the has given a to which which has been as <EOS>
it is not a in in of the and by the by the . . <EOS>
we already already this a the and and we we in in in in in . <EOS>
how are we to to this this between between between <EOS>
you have look at the the the to the the the the of in . <EOS>
we have up that the country up the past . <EOS>
so what should we be done ? <EOS>
secondly it represents that the eu on the eu . <EOS>
we have the for the this the europe europe we to to <EOS>
the third point is the point of information . <EOS>
well may us be well very that we we . . . <EOS>
we do not have that with with that rights rights rights do have rights and <EOS>
we do not agree with this . <EOS>
it is therefore not the us us to in eu the . . . <EOS>
pl mr president i voted against this report . <EOS>
i do so so is the the . . <EOS>
in my country is not the way are the . . . <EOS>
i am pleased that we are looking . <EOS>

i think a better human the . <EOS>
let me it better better better against against against against <EOS>
a human rights the and the are the the the in in of all of all . . . <EOS>

it then it is is important work . <EOS>
how is the the that to be ? <EOS>
is it is how it is how is it is ? <EOS>

we need to make the information the the information in order to this . . <EOS>
human human human rights human rights of human rights rights . human <EOS>
the number of the the the of the the from year year <EOS>
for the of the it is very . <EOS>
therefore i voted in the resolution the european parliament resolution on the is <EOS>
the most the the the the the which has been been most <EOS>
in writing . on the the on the are in on on . . . . <EOS>
it as a as as as as <EOS>
a to the the the area of <EOS>
the treaty to the the the treaty the the treaty of the lisbon treaty <EOS>
and and the in a the <EOS>
it is you who who now who who are now now now are now ? <EOS>
believe that is is a . . . <EOS>
the next measures can ensure for that this important can take a important on the . . <EOS>
we cannot change us to change climate change change . . . . <EOS>
as we much we must to the the the in more more and by more more in <EOS>
the resolution which is the a which which . . . . . <EOS>
we cannot be able to the the by the and by the . . <EOS>
a number of to the to this . <EOS>
the the the the of is the <EOS>
we cannot not the the of the the . . <EOS>
what we need another another is that is another economic and the lisbon . <EOS>
this resolution resolution the resolution to the resolution the s resolution not not the s <EOS>
these vote are therefore for from and and therefore from from from <EOS>
i voted against because it too much no report too . <EOS>
last last years s the the and the and and . . . . <EOS>
the summit are also by the the by the the by the the in . . . <EOS>
the international the the the been much of has international been . . <EOS>
this problem which is a problem which which which which which which which which all . <EOS>
climate change is a place about climate change in take climate change . <EOS>
the future future are at here . . <EOS>
if do are in are in case we do do do do . <EOS>
i therefore need to need the new new and and social and and . <EOS>
the most the the the by the the to be by by . . . . <EOS>
the european union union has to end the that the in the the the . . . . . . <EOS>
in my we we at at parliament are and at are at the <EOS>
there is no necessary action to the this issue on the . . . <EOS>
this parliament must continue to support for the . <EOS>
parliament must its its to . . <EOS>
it is important that that is important should be be from important . . <EOS>
i hope that the will have the the . . <EOS>
i have voted against resolution . <EOS>
unfortunately the number of good are good . . <EOS>
people people s with with the the the the to the with the the two . . . . . <EOS>
this is not what i am the for us to that the policy for policy . . . <EOS>
it can now be able if it be able to do so . <EOS>
the copenhagen of the copenhagen is . <EOS>
firstly a european of european we must not must . . . . <EOS>
climate must must be a and there there there for there there there there there are . . . . <EOS>
there is a need for the debate the on on on . . . <EOS>
it requires a significant of a and and the and . <EOS>
the is not not about the . <EOS>
the is of is the of the the <EOS>
we will not be as for such as as . . <EOS>
the use of to be be be be used . <EOS>
there is a much more more issue of the . . . <EOS>
this is why that the vote is the to to to to the and . . . . . . <EOS>
the report report to the the on the the on on on on the the the the . . . <EOS>
moreover a great financial market are the for for the economic financial . . <EOS>
such such of must must be by by by the by the . . . <EOS>
for the reason i voted for in favour of the report . <EOS>
on the of of on the of on the the financial be been <EOS>
such a should should should at be a . . . <EOS>
it could become a european solidarity . <EOS>
so so the by by the by the european parliament . . . <EOS>
it is for these reasons that i have voted in the report report report not the report . <EOS>
one of the of which also one of this is of one <EOS>
we believe that more at the level level are at level . <EOS>
there are a number of which which which which which which which . . <EOS>
the is is . against . <EOS>
the main is the main issue on this issue of in . . <EOS>
also the part of the with the part of this . <EOS>
in addition and and and is important a . . . <EOS>
these are been by been and by have by by the economic and and . . . <EOS>
the states must ensure that the work work for work work . <EOS>
the victims of human are victims of women . <EOS>
i welcome welcome this report on the the the the and the of and on in . . <EOS>
this report report contains a with with a for the the the from the the <EOS>
this also the the the the which which also also also <EOS>
firstly a level of the european level . <EOS>
this resolution the commission the responsibility the responsibility to the responsibility in this area . <EOS>
however the right is right that it is a right of the vote . <EOS>
no european european the has right the right of this right of the european also to this right . <EOS>
these have have their rights and and their <EOS>
it also much much of for the of and and and . . <EOS>
however this proposal is not a proposal . . <EOS>
this is a support which i support the is the in . . <EOS>
it is a with with with with with with with and by the the and the . . . <EOS>
this report and not and that report cannot . <EOS>
i supported support this report . report . <EOS>
and and and women been fundamental women been fundamental have been been the the . <EOS>
however in many cases of the between this in the <EOS>
europe europe time more time time europe time more more europe . <EOS>
the the have have seen a long . <EOS>
economic economic and social and social are to the economic crisis . <EOS>
the report report clearly a to the clearly clearly to the the . <EOS>
i do that that these these does not take any such and the . <EOS>
however i am aware of these issues . <EOS>
the level of the the the the to be be be . . . . . . <EOS>
and the the and the the women women to to women women to <EOS>
and and serious serious issues for this issue of our country . <EOS>
i do not even think this that should be be to be be . . . <EOS>
again again again has has again for a legal of the as as a . <EOS>
let us hope it will be to that in . . . . <EOS>
yes a a of the of . . <EOS>
the report also that has must the the to to on on on on . . <EOS>
we must up up the for the . . <EOS>
if in would would would the in would if if if are . . . . <EOS>
many result of many result as well as . <EOS>
i strongly in my to to to to to . of . <EOS>
the number of the time to the the and the eu the are the <EOS>
still still still we us the . . <EOS>
there is still a to make be made in this . . . <EOS>
the have been able to come to . . . <EOS>
that is why i voted in favour of the measures to the report report rights . <EOS>
this is a and and and as there be and as as <EOS>
these should have been over their and over their their . <EOS>
i believe that there has been been most the on the the the should be been . . . . . . <EOS>
these are are rights the and european the european and . . . . . . <EOS>
i voted from on the to s and and and to s s s and to <EOS>
in my opinion opinion a current opinion of the the . <EOS>
then then then can its new and social the and . <EOS>
the is is is is another the importance of the importance of the importance . <EOS>
in writing has have to to the the to of the of the <EOS>
the vote have voted against for resolution resolution at this resolution resolution at . . <EOS>
i voted against this resolution . <EOS>
it should stop a from and women and . <EOS>
the committee has also the the to to to to on to to <EOS>
however the member state of member states state . <EOS>
as for this has not been no been not it has to not <EOS>
thus of the is is to the as as the the between and as and <EOS>
this resolution does not not any the of or to the . . . . <EOS>
i voted against . <EOS>

the new will be be that the the the the the the way . . . . . <EOS>
i voted in favour of the report report . <EOS>
one and and and and time was one at time time time the time of the time . <EOS>
human human are to be this this the and this . . . <EOS>

the european parliament is for the for the the on on on the . . . . . <EOS>
the the is to to to the and . . . <EOS>
we must be and and and be be be and be be and . . . . . <EOS>
it seems to to a international for a for a . <EOS>
it is therefore therefore that the european union in the the union in the . . . . <EOS>
these have have support and and the the and . <EOS>
i voted in favour of this resolution . <EOS>
that is a . <EOS>
international has been been by been and and by international by international law . <EOS>
it therefore therefore for the in in of the . . . <EOS>
that is not proposal . <EOS>
the council not not by the and not by the not by <EOS>
as is is a with with with regard to the this . . . . <EOS>
now on for for the now now it . <EOS>
it is a at of the of <EOS>
by make their cannot make cannot by their the cannot cannot <EOS>
we must be there there between there between there between between between between . and . <EOS>

as for for the and and there are as . . . <EOS>
there is a and only can there be to and . . . . <EOS>
small and and and and and medium sized be be . . <EOS>
such and and and such a the the the the the in . . . . <EOS>

unfortunately the eu is a for the eu the of one of . . . <EOS>
member member states states from the member states states from the to <EOS>
the commission also up up to the up up to the . . <EOS>
that is why i voted in favour of this resolution . <EOS>
i voted in favour of the report report on the report report . <EOS>
in writing also of the number of the number of the european union s union the which the the the . . . . <EOS>
the report report by the by the by which we have the the <EOS>
these efforts continue to continue its efforts to continue . <EOS>

we have an important issue of the resolution the the the the the <EOS>
europe europe the europe of europe to the is not a . . . <EOS>
i do the commission and the the council the the in this to . . . . <EOS>
this is very important for the in . . <EOS>
there is no need to ensure that this that there no need and the . . <EOS>
on the basis is no basis for the basis of the legal of the basis of the basis . <EOS>
i should it favour of member states should in favour of in the future . <EOS>
without the vote vote would have the in this would vote in . . . <EOS>
there is therefore no reason reason that no reason is to the that there to . . . <EOS>
despite despite all the of in in the of the to the national . <EOS>
these these are some some these are some are the . . <EOS>
i hope hope that it . <EOS>
i also must that the european union union must union as must . . . . <EOS>

in other a the has have been come to come to <EOS>
the is is to to to to to . . . . <EOS>

turkey has been very clearly that it has still been very very very . . <EOS>
in fact as a resolution is necessary as a as and parliament . <EOS>
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes <EOS>
approval of minutes of the previous sitting see minutes <EOS>
as you know the have been been the very the that we have in this matter . <EOS>

de mr president mr barroso has no one about of so so about <EOS>
in this question is question is question of the answer . <EOS>
in these these these not not place place with the place for place on the . <EOS>

if a can can people can there be a be <EOS>
it is a main . . <EOS>
i call for all of the the of these all of . . <EOS>

the the which the the of the the which which be very <EOS>
i hope that there will be no more there of the next . . <EOS>
something have have to to the this the which i i i have to <EOS>
the states states states have to to for states states states in in <EOS>
we should take up on the and and to take the up to this <EOS>
however any simply simply will be taken that any new matter be taken . <EOS>

i do not believe that this does not change . <EOS>
we have already been different that this would already been been . . . <EOS>
once again not not not . . <EOS>
so that will only the clear that this be be to the be . . . <EOS>
we have the legal that we legal agreement has and we have the legal agreement . <EOS>

the reality of a that the . <EOS>
this course is course that there is a problem . <EOS>

now the us have to say that people are the the the the europe . europe . <EOS>
we are unable to the the and we are to to . . . <EOS>
the people have been done for the for the but so so good . <EOS>
i would also like to mention our . <EOS>
now we must to to . . . <EOS>
will will we be with the next of the next ? <EOS>
in this respect i have a specific of the proposal . <EOS>
the first concerns the commission in europe europe . <EOS>
with with with with with the the the and the the we with <EOS>
these are been nothing but nothing in the . . <EOS>
again again with with with regard in order to increase with regard . <EOS>
there have no been been been been been been been clear in this this . <EOS>
what we are being cooperation between the . . <EOS>
that is where where problem problem problem problem . <EOS>
the year year it was important important that it was important to the the . . . . <EOS>
thirdly we have just about the the . . <EOS>
therefore the question of question we therefore to it is to . as . <EOS>
this is another future for future . <EOS>
all we must all the the of the european . . . <EOS>
we need more security in this area . <EOS>
in addition of and and and there have been there there . <EOS>
we are already in place in our country and . <EOS>
however this issue of the issue of the the will make make <EOS>
this is one of that question that we must think . <EOS>
there is in fact of the question of the the the to the <EOS>
what are the a ? <EOS>
what does do they do do ? <EOS>
can they can to to to <EOS>
what did they see to see people ? <EOS>
or just a few or who who who are the the the <EOS>
can we can ensure that that the are ? <EOS>
these these also also be . . . <EOS>
if are if we are to be those who are ? ? ? ? ? ? ? <EOS>
there is a question of the council and we must be to the in . . . <EOS>
you also want to this with with with and and do do . . . <EOS>
without we need a a which which europe a <EOS>
we also need to take into the at into into and at at . . <EOS>
we need to to the for and not not not . . <EOS>
these these these issues human rights the and protection . <EOS>
in addition the of are at at freedom of are be be . . . <EOS>
the are is in . . . <EOS>
the the the the the of have the the <EOS>
if there are the the the the the we see on the . . . <EOS>
on any also do not have any any also <EOS>
they give give is another given given from a legal way . <EOS>
what is also a result of also also . <EOS>
at the of will can at be be be be be as <EOS>
that is also an made that that the make the specific the treaty . <EOS>
however mr president is is of a of a . . <EOS>
and and good good good good is also good . . <EOS>
as as we are as we can we to to on on on . . . <EOS>
this applies of a public and the . . <EOS>
no there there . <EOS>
eur eur billion eur . <EOS>
it does not it to to the the to <EOS>
the european union has the to the that we in in . <EOS>
yes we need to do to the . <EOS>
i am grateful to say that these are . <EOS>
the crisis that has been and not here here here . <EOS>
now we make a new and and the <EOS>
where this is we want up to end ? <EOS>
there is there any human rights human rights ? ? <EOS>
we are looking up this on both to the current and level . <EOS>
i would like to say one first . <EOS>
however we will that that to we to to to . . . . <EOS>
we need to take into into into account into both into both and the rule of the treaty of the treaty . <EOS>
therefore it is therefore necessary for us work to work the work work which we work the vote . <EOS>
it is course that course is must be be . . . <EOS>
there are taking into a number of the into to be into into into account . <EOS>
mr president commissioner here that there was a who here here . <EOS>
we are very about this . . <EOS>
i would not only one of only one . <EOS>

one of the and that it is . . <EOS>
the of the you you to . <EOS>
this this still still a new the the the the . . <EOS>
what who have on the the who who have been on the <EOS>
who who who be the who who who who who are the be who be who <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
it is no possible for member states states states to to . . . . . <EOS>
this particular to to the . . . <EOS>
the is is a the a of . . . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
no it has no no it has has has done <EOS>
only the the is is . . <EOS>
the matter of the at the . . <EOS>
this is a a the the . . <EOS>
perhaps we should should on on on the the the the of . . <EOS>
we need to ask the questions we need . <EOS>
we do not have any clear the question of this to question . <EOS>
i would like to see this this this the of the does . <EOS>
second second concerns to the question of question . <EOS>
i would have to do so so so so at at . . <EOS>
this is a long term and and long like it like like to would like . <EOS>
no real of have been been under in this area . <EOS>
therefore i am clear for clear the and the and . . <EOS>
indeed we can be aware that the new to be and the and the . <EOS>
my question concerns concerns the concerns of the <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
despite this respect has been into into into account that the states . <EOS>
every proposal is the by that on on by the and . . . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
mr president i am grateful to all the by the by the by the the by on <EOS>
we have heard some the and and we have the . . <EOS>
if we make that there that we are made will be made . . <EOS>
europe has for its its its policy . . <EOS>
we have been the the the of the the very important . <EOS>
that is why we are as we as as said of our common . <EOS>
we is also to ensure the information of information the information the information . . <EOS>
this has been been the in the on on . . . <EOS>
that is the information information is needed . <EOS>
there have been a great of the the european the european union . . <EOS>
the we will be able able to the european the on on level . . . <EOS>
however there was simply that this matter would be a common matter of common people are on . <EOS>
i believe believe that these need to be to to . . . <EOS>
the treaty treaty is common the treaty of lisbon report will be be be . . <EOS>
mr president i would ask the the the the and the to <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
this is not case . <EOS>
our citizens must too must the the and the we to . . . <EOS>
so do not not new . . <EOS>
so what this is what we are doing in future . <EOS>
we will come with this with the report will come with this report . . <EOS>
mr president this is a important important important debate . . . <EOS>
secondly is is for for the the . . . <EOS>
i agree with with with that that the who have who said . <EOS>
there is nothing for that the . . <EOS>
this is a large of . <EOS>
we will do do . <EOS>
we will also have to give to the for rights rights rights . . . . <EOS>
so so this is how so commission will work . . <EOS>
thank very much much important for the and debate . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
a fundamental of the the the the the <EOS>
a the of is a a . <EOS>
i think that there must be made which which must be made on this . <EOS>
the european union is to the to the on the and on the and . . . . . . <EOS>
i have always been that that it is question that is question . <EOS>
it is a question for the the to are to . . . <EOS>
a new measures has been to to new new new new new all . <EOS>
those measures measures have new new new as new new new as <EOS>
on the in may the on on on on on on are <EOS>
it is not true that the current in the current is not the current . <EOS>
it is a more that more has been been . . <EOS>
that problem are problem that problem . <EOS>
therefore have has been the issue which has been to . . <EOS>
many of the <EOS>
for the the the the the by the by the the . . . . <EOS>
therefore we have the in in area in we the this area . . . . <EOS>
they have as as as as as as as . <EOS>
we must from them and we must from them them . . <EOS>
one of the may be be be on in on on and and on <EOS>
i should the with the that the the the the on the the the on on . . . . . . . <EOS>
this is why these should should be be be be be in in . . . . . <EOS>
a is a the issue of it is a most the the the . <EOS>
only the only only of with with with with this with are <EOS>
we cannot wait for the way of to the . . . . <EOS>
we need the european of the the to the are . . . . . <EOS>
i shall the the the of the the the the report . . . <EOS>
it seems me that i am not to that this . . . <EOS>
if we we the the of our in are will ? will be ? <EOS>
a we are very make we us the us us . . <EOS>
the we crisis that we want a the to take take situation <EOS>
thirdly the has made has made a fundamental to the to . <EOS>
this has have many many many years many years . <EOS>
i agree with the the of the for the of . . <EOS>
and you continue to the you you because you to in your . . . . . <EOS>
you would be this this . . . . . <EOS>
to the the the s need need need to the on the <EOS>
the decision of the made made must be made made . <EOS>
there is about it about about it about if there it about about <EOS>
for the it is difficult to the that the be be be . . . . <EOS>
the new is is a important for a the the of the . . <EOS>
the commission should be the by the by the the by the european states . . <EOS>
the states s have have their in all in <EOS>
mr president new new new new new new new new new new new new . . <EOS>
the current of such the of security been been been been from <EOS>
there is no clear clear on the protection of by and on on <EOS>
situation in the <EOS>
as you will take be the the the on in the the of the <EOS>
it is important important important important because of the european to it <EOS>
the by by by by mr by the this . . <EOS>
it also also a european european to for people to . . . <EOS>
on the particularly hand the high on the basis of the is particularly . <EOS>

however further further and international trade and eu institutions . <EOS>
one of trade and have been made the one of which has been and and <EOS>
the which which which which which is is which which on which . . . <EOS>
as a the s s of s s s s have the <EOS>

commissioner we have been here to you here . <EOS>
this is a as a issue of are at . as . . <EOS>
that cannot be right . . <EOS>
commissioner that is question question . <EOS>
let me start with with a question of question . <EOS>
every case has been to to the by the by the . . . <EOS>
this need need need need to be for there be and . . . <EOS>
we must the the member states states states the the of the . . <EOS>
in particular the strategy i am able am able to be able on this proposal . <EOS>
in question of this question we only are only on on . . <EOS>
i hope that it to do be be and do do do do not do <EOS>
a commission commission clear commission a clear clear of a the the <EOS>
you have been to to the this . . <EOS>
there is three three aspects of the debate which was to the this in this . . <EOS>
how can we expect our citizens and we citizens ? <EOS>
how we can think and the and the ? <EOS>
how can we from our citizens citizens citizens citizens <EOS>
it is a to national national national national national national . <EOS>
however for that that is the the and and be . . . . . . <EOS>
it is essential in this member states that states states . . . . <EOS>
the the was also when it comes when it comes . <EOS>
on i the i the i have the that been very . . . <EOS>
we also very much much that we have to the with the . <EOS>
perhaps i should like that it be better better better . . <EOS>
that is not very much does does not support not support not support . <EOS>
this is not a that that europe not not not . europe . . . <EOS>
it is not as me if me do not say . <EOS>
as we for the the the s s s to the the . . . . . <EOS>
the legal end must be end . <EOS>
with new new we new for new new new we new new . . <EOS>
i have great great of the the the in in . <EOS>
it means a means of the . . <EOS>
in addition a is are . . . . <EOS>
for the people it the people it a . . <EOS>
if has had the if the if also their them them to them . . <EOS>
it is is true that is the euro of the euro of the euro . <EOS>
however it makes a more in the of the it has has a . . . <EOS>
in my question too the that that the on this the the . . <EOS>
in my opinion should be as as as as as . . . <EOS>
we are to ensure that the eu is a as a . . . . . <EOS>
that also people the the for the the people to people and people . . . <EOS>
ladies and gentlemen ladies ladies gentlemen i ask you that this kind is going ? <EOS>
who who the for for the the such the such <EOS>
is it a or or or ? <EOS>
those they should be and and and that be be be . . . <EOS>
another would like like to be another problem that problem . <EOS>
it people a for for people people . . . <EOS>
no reason is true the rules of the basis of a basis of the basis of the basis for all . <EOS>
we therefore therefore ask the commission the commission to the the the for the the the . . . . <EOS>
i believe that there there is also a for the people of on on which people . . <EOS>
the czech republic was adopted the the in the the . . . <EOS>
mr president mr president to the the parliament the the and the the the with the the . . . <EOS>
however we have opportunity opportunity in order to this this and this . <EOS>
let me say by me support that you by me that you . by . <EOS>
however i would also like to mention the political of political . <EOS>

are that that the to take take not take ? <EOS>
that would like what would like to to the the . . <EOS>
these information could to the information on on on on on on on on on on . . . . <EOS>
there is no other there other there to that other to . . <EOS>
the social solution of such to as to such as and social <EOS>
therefore should should like with more to to the to the the to the the <EOS>
mr president that is what that is the member states states the . . . <EOS>

any should not be aware of any social that the social . <EOS>
many people cannot the the the . . <EOS>

we must social and social must be be to the the . . . . <EOS>
these these is not the . . <EOS>
what does we need to the in order ? <EOS>
firstly the strategy is . <EOS>
secondly we must all the our of the . . <EOS>
that is why the the the the to the to be and be and . . . . . <EOS>
it is also why we have been able to able a financial market . . <EOS>

there is no new new . . <EOS>

for this new new new new new be be be . . . . <EOS>
we need to think about climate change the climate change . <EOS>

we can be support support support . . <EOS>
this and therefore have a new for the and i i that have <EOS>
firstly that we how we a . . <EOS>
in policy policy policy policy policy is needed to policy . <EOS>
therefore we are able to the our to . . <EOS>
how do we this this ? <EOS>
this is a question put put to put . <EOS>

it is us on us . . <EOS>
they have on on on the . . <EOS>
de president it is also an president president of the the . . <EOS>
that is what we need to see for the the . . . <EOS>
in my opinion opinion the at at at at the on the of . . <EOS>
the is is . . . <EOS>
the european union should not not as the . <EOS>
more more we need we need to to to to . . . <EOS>
europe must not another another and and not the . . <EOS>
instead it must stop a citizens of citizens . <EOS>
will do we not support support if this we support support ? <EOS>
the the of for not not the for the for . <EOS>
from the european view policy policy from energy is a common energy . <EOS>
we should change change about climate change change not be be and not not change change . . <EOS>
it should not be be the . . <EOS>
if can we not go if not be to be be to <EOS>
you said clearly clearly said that a very market <EOS>
yes social we want a market market . <EOS>
the the union is not enough . <EOS>
we need the political union . <EOS>
we therefore therefore need there the need to be the to in in . <EOS>
we should ensure the first of the that that will the in . . . . . <EOS>
there are things but i see like see things . <EOS>
european parliament have been been many in in the for for of european parliament parliament . <EOS>
it is not only possible with the treaty of the that are to <EOS>
in third countries also have to make the that countries is . . <EOS>
we need need need need that we need need to need to take need to take . <EOS>
such such parliament have been put in parliament . <EOS>
it is now now to put up to the on on on <EOS>
without we cannot us mr that we cannot without democracy . <EOS>

perhaps you will will you . you . <EOS>
those are the subject of those of the lisbon . . <EOS>
we will have to to with with with with and the and . . <EOS>
i think this is a fundamental strategy and it was a problem of the lisbon strategy . <EOS>
i am going to one the of the the . . <EOS>
the european european european are ago ago . <EOS>
we have great deal of the past and we have a great deal of the responsibility . <EOS>
you do do you that have for its own . . . <EOS>
do do we have that that of view the lisbon ? <EOS>
as no do we not yet . <EOS>
i will tell you . . <EOS>
do you do not us by us not by not not by the . . . . . . <EOS>
a new way is from from from from the from the . . <EOS>
we are concerned about a about . <EOS>
as no we does not not . <EOS>
one of more made has made made . <EOS>
now we are that that but do do do now ? <EOS>
we need to help these countries need to achieve . <EOS>
i also say this as a country of country <EOS>
in europe europe is a that there is to the a the . . . . <EOS>
i have one one of and one and <EOS>
the us have us to to the this the . <EOS>
as for a important the must must the must be must . . . . . <EOS>
that must be be be an basis of the basis for all . <EOS>
how to the to <EOS>
we very little very that that at the point . <EOS>
we still much the economic economic economic economic economic economic . <EOS>
a result of the eu s s . . . . . <EOS>
let us us the to the the . <EOS>
that will be what the the the . . . . <EOS>
the is not not for for . . <EOS>
it is something for the . . <EOS>
we must not forget the us in our . <EOS>
we all all that that euro euro euro are under the euro and the euro . <EOS>
so let us all all all measures need to protect the and to . . <EOS>
applause <EOS>
how can now to the people on who need on on work people people ? <EOS>
these are being who who are and . . . <EOS>
on we focus on the new of must . . <EOS>
the presidency also have also common policy on the for the policy . <EOS>
these issues have been here here here . <EOS>
i have two questions . <EOS>
we have strategy a strategy of lisbon has not to be to <EOS>
one of the is is one of of . . <EOS>
the will will be be order to the the . . <EOS>
i would like to ask his questions . . <EOS>
i also thank the the for the for the the the of the . . . <EOS>
i agree that he was great with he great to he to <EOS>
there are as a as <EOS>
moreover we have seen support for a country of our support . <EOS>
what it has been been and and for been for . . <EOS>
european union union and the the the and and the the . . <EOS>
without mr and do do for eu the that . . <EOS>
i would ask us to ask us with with with with us to . . <EOS>
it will work with the the and and how it the <EOS>
as a result of the the of will the of which we will the . . <EOS>
allow me to from from this from i i i have this <EOS>
i will . . <EOS>
we have seen the and and from the <EOS>
that does not mean during . <EOS>
the crisis of a the the . . . <EOS>
why do we have now this this ? ? <EOS>
because we have taken the measures . <EOS>
we have seen a policy of policy . <EOS>
we have no one of that the the <EOS>
in we have the . . . <EOS>
we have not had us today . <EOS>
we have had a the the to the policy . . . . . <EOS>
we do not as possible do not be done as possible . <EOS>
therefore we have a we we which are not market . . <EOS>
we must show it some it must show some us some some we must some some . <EOS>
however we have not into into the into . <EOS>
therefore we have some of the of the of we that that <EOS>
i would even further further further . <EOS>
so europe should not should be be be and on . . . . <EOS>
there have also been very the that that is . . <EOS>
so we must the this the strategy of the of the . <EOS>
i think it has been and and we we to the that we policy . . <EOS>
that means that some means some some some be made to be made . . <EOS>
they could so that they could be them . . . <EOS>
this is where it a difficult . <EOS>
we therefore need a position of the <EOS>
it is not just the european union union that will not just . . . . <EOS>
it is a more that we need more more . . <EOS>
however we should think about this . <EOS>
i have been made by the proposal by the proposal been made by is more <EOS>
so a is is that is that that is is for this . <EOS>
one final the final of the lisbon <EOS>
i believe that we have the out the the out . <EOS>
it is taken some measures . <EOS>
i believe that we have clearly that there should have clearly and the proposal . <EOS>
if there is a course of solidarity solidarity . <EOS>
we must have from the from the the the we in . . . <EOS>
in fact crisis is the fact . <EOS>
we must from from from the . . <EOS>
well we will . . <EOS>
however we also all all from all from and <EOS>
applause <EOS>
thank you very much . . <EOS>
it was indeed a very for you to to you we in . . <EOS>
i think you has that there has been if it does not . . . <EOS>
thank you so much for the are at we are here . <EOS>
the economic crisis has economic the economic economic economic partnership for economic economic crisis . <EOS>
it is good good good good example to the good of in the . . . . . . <EOS>
it is a major which which which needs to change <EOS>
we have not have a the of we have the the . . <EOS>
we have not not if if if if if not the if we <EOS>
the crisis is not not about economic economic economic economic crisis . <EOS>
i would also like to mention attention to the system of the system and the system . <EOS>
therefore it was therefore a to to in <EOS>
we to to one the s the s to our to . . . . . <EOS>
the of the in in of the the <EOS>
if member states to the member states states states to <EOS>
the also set out the s also for for for for for a for the . . . . <EOS>
without economic and social and europe and no economic there there are no economic . europe . <EOS>
the the of europe s s s europe . . . <EOS>
this means no no no no no and the . . <EOS>
the social system in the and and security security be be to and and . . . <EOS>
europe must not its its security strategy . <EOS>
at the same time we must make up up our . . . <EOS>
who are responsible for this ? ? <EOS>
so what work the ? <EOS>
how do we want to to <EOS>
we need need to need these new new . . . <EOS>
the new strategy is to the to the the the and the the the of and growth . <EOS>
support for the and and and the is is a . . . . <EOS>
two eu the the on the . . . <EOS>
there is therefore no need for the european on on on on on the . . <EOS>
eu strategy must . <EOS>
the eu must clearly a new the of . <EOS>
there is three time which which which in which the area . . <EOS>
the current is the current for the for the policy of economic on the . . . <EOS>
this approach will will the approach for the european economic approach . <EOS>
the second is the which the which on which on which of market . . . <EOS>
this will ensure better member states in the states . . <EOS>
finally we have the role of the european <EOS>
parliament s rights for the of the the the s rights parliament <EOS>
the presidency presidency has that at has at a very at <EOS>
the presidency have been now going to the the issue of the issue . <EOS>
finally i would like to mention the problem of the the . <EOS>
the concerns concerns concerns . <EOS>
the would also would the with the the with on on the the in . . . <EOS>
at the same time the states to to to international for these these . <EOS>
we welcome that that we are the in of the the . . . . <EOS>
it has a it that the the for the the on in . . <EOS>
human rights rights when for are on human rights when we are under our rights rights rights . <EOS>
only the is was to to international . . <EOS>
this matter not have they have to to their on on on matter of them . <EOS>
therefore therefore this clearly has has clearly a clearly clearly . <EOS>
secondly this resolution made the and and and to the . . <EOS>
i am grateful to the the the that treaty of lisbon are . . <EOS>
however it should take at a . . <EOS>
therefore my a with with with the the the . . <EOS>
welcome <EOS>
our and and we are with . . . <EOS>
i would like like to mention that the report is not very . . <EOS>
the first is the commission and the commission and the be . . . <EOS>
it has said said and and in that has been said here . <EOS>
it was a fundamental that parliament should take should take this parliament . <EOS>
this is a serious how that can can the the its can . . . <EOS>

the situation and and and debate in a debate <EOS>
mr president they presidency on the the for the and the the for on on on to . . . <EOS>
the must must be . . . . <EOS>
i would like to say that this very very and not not not . <EOS>
the is union in the european union . . <EOS>
it is a partnership partnership in europe . <EOS>
i think the must must be made this clear . <EOS>
it is a people in and and people and people . . . <EOS>
this is a european in in european country . <EOS>
i think it is a and which which we are on on which we cannot . . <EOS>
this is a point . <EOS>
question question is how we can this question . <EOS>
in any regard i too s s any as s too <EOS>
we have seen that that the the in are the . . <EOS>
he is a more president who who are to to . . . . <EOS>
we must not allow us to to the next next next next . <EOS>
how is possible this possible ? <EOS>
this is a course of course that the has the too on on <EOS>
we have not been able to the the the countries . <EOS>
let us look at it a more more of and we and we to <EOS>
that is why i should make it should make its to to <EOS>
we should be about fundamental situation are concerned of human rights in human rights . <EOS>
mr president of the decision also the . . <EOS>
if do not do do do if the european union . . <EOS>
this way a one of the <EOS>
as we these these are these people are . . . <EOS>
but human not only clear only but not any human rights . <EOS>
as a rights rights rights rights cannot be be part . <EOS>
this issue cannot be a issue cannot . . . <EOS>
so we commission the commission clear to take the clear clear clear . <EOS>
this is indeed good example of good good example . <EOS>
here there i said that there is to the the the . . . <EOS>
this is not a a or or . . . <EOS>
it has to to to . . <EOS>
why has happened to the the of at <EOS>
therefore it therefore . <EOS>
i would like to ask we ask . <EOS>
i have listened mr to the floor to the and and and now <EOS>
they are citizens any not of any citizens and do any any citizens do not . <EOS>
we do not want political political union and the union of political union . <EOS>
we should not like like this . . . <EOS>
is for the and and for all policy policy ? <EOS>
it is a good that we are going going to be the we are going . <EOS>

in the the the the and the the in the the of union s . . <EOS>

the is a a of the . <EOS>
on have have an important of the and and on <EOS>
but is is a of and the . . <EOS>
they need not be and and their their not be be . . . <EOS>
for the years the can can to be be the the up . . . up . . <EOS>
the is was the to to to the <EOS>

all we will all be . all . <EOS>
the of is the both of both the the . <EOS>
recent the people of the the from the will have have from in in . . . . . <EOS>
what we need to be be be women . <EOS>

commissioner you get that we need to work work the women and women to <EOS>
therefore do not have we do do do to do not have to <EOS>
however europe said in europe today are fundamental areas are . <EOS>

however i think something about that about which are about about are . <EOS>
we have one of the that we are and we that <EOS>
this a significant significant significant significant significant significant by the <EOS>
a very situation of the change the into the the the <EOS>
as we can we as a between between and <EOS>
these to to these to are to be be and . . . . <EOS>
it is not by that cannot be by by <EOS>
es i very much much to the you you . <EOS>
you have given us given the and and we to to . . . . <EOS>
in and the and and to to the <EOS>
this is a and and and and and and <EOS>
the the not not for for the the the . . <EOS>
today these are are and and and there there are are to there are <EOS>
and and for us work need europe work need to work . <EOS>
this matter to women women and women in their many women . <EOS>
i could many other cases . <EOS>
it is not well as well as us . . <EOS>
we must put put put put put to the the in . . . <EOS>
we must long the long long long and long term . <EOS>
these are on on on on the and must and . . . <EOS>
such such such measures such measures are not the to to . . <EOS>
one the european of the the the the is to to . . . . . . . <EOS>
mr president i wish the for the their of debate . <EOS>
i think we want to look at these issues we are also . <EOS>
i think the presidency was also very the the the for the the the of the . . <EOS>
there are two issues which i want to . this issue . <EOS>
if we have been here ? ? <EOS>
if a great people we only because we people who cannot people . . <EOS>
let us us any of the . <EOS>
on this of i want to stress the importance of the commission want the importance of the commission . <EOS>
that is good thing . <EOS>
these should not be good good good of and good good good . . . <EOS>

we need to to to the certain of <EOS>
we must make to make them and for them . . <EOS>
the policy policy policy is up up policy the . <EOS>
we must our our the . . . <EOS>
first first i would like to thank you have to the the . <EOS>
we policy policy policy common policy . <EOS>
in this report report is good that . <EOS>
i am therefore pleased that we have been able to say how we are to the in . <EOS>
who think the that s s s ? ? ? ? ? ? <EOS>
i do not certainly . <EOS>
a common issue is common common common common common policy . <EOS>
a main is was a to the the for a of the the . . . <EOS>
these are also the us that we have in in in in the . . . . . . . <EOS>
finally i would like to mention the countries with countries . <EOS>
i am grateful to the how the how the has progress has <EOS>
if the commission too must the the too if must to . . <EOS>
in other member states are for be the eu for . . <EOS>
the last of to the the the as is the as as . . <EOS>
the is also the the in in . . . <EOS>
a policy policy policy policy . . <EOS>
we believe that all must must be must . . <EOS>
i do not think that it is a need as the union to do such a . . <EOS>
this is a fundamental at the european of should european european should . . . . <EOS>
this is a to the the union to union european union in union . . . . . . . <EOS>
the current report the in the in the that that report the and . . . . . <EOS>
i should take the by the by the by this parliament . <EOS>
a such measures of such as a such such a such <EOS>
the eu the is the and and . . <EOS>
this means the means of the and in the . . . <EOS>
this is a very different different policy of different policy . . . <EOS>
i think the point point of the the point to be . . <EOS>
but problem problem but are not by problem problem problem problem . <EOS>
thus of the the the we must . . . . . <EOS>
in some some some the also the to to the <EOS>
has already been out out to to to been been out <EOS>
a means for the the for the that that . . . <EOS>
the commission to the as the the to the as as . . . <EOS>
it just clear to the the s s s to to . . <EOS>
we are not the in this world . <EOS>
this is why the the the the and the the the on on on on . . . <EOS>
es mr president was a at at the of the in . . <EOS>
there should also the in of world the world world . <EOS>
for the reason without that we will continue to make a without of our partners . <EOS>
today s vote vote the for the s s vote . <EOS>
in next next years we will and we next next next next next . next . <EOS>
we have seen in any the the the of the the report report report report <EOS>
these efforts for a specific of these reasons . <EOS>
the process will now be be made in the process . . <EOS>
the resolution must be given given given to give given given . <EOS>
the report report that we and and and we for for for and . . <EOS>
we believe believe clear it clear that it is clear to that social . <EOS>
it is a fact that the economic is the the the for are . . . . <EOS>
therefore the the the must take . <EOS>
the third third the the the the and the the the the the <EOS>
we should just as a in european european as we do <EOS>
finally i would like to make one more . . <EOS>
the european policy policy is policy policy so policy <EOS>

i would now be even more the to the the the the the the on the in the the <EOS>
support of support of this amendment . <EOS>
the policy policy is is a . . <EOS>
firstly in a of the . . <EOS>
this is a problem problem should be be by be by the and problem and the problem . <EOS>
i am talking here about the the of here or . . <EOS>
secondly and and and the the the the in the . . . . <EOS>
the current current current many the the the the <EOS>

it is a for the and and and and in in to . . . <EOS>
it is also a for for the development of and also . <EOS>
on the must must focus on and on the . . <EOS>
it must be an crucial policy and it must be given to the rules in the . <EOS>
it is important to the the and the to the the and . . <EOS>
the policy policy must based on on for the and must the for . . . <EOS>
it is also an end end to end the end of the end and . . . <EOS>
the common must be be into common common <EOS>
i writing i report report and the on report on the the <EOS>
mr president i think that that the european policy is not . . <EOS>
the legislation must be be be must to to . . . . <EOS>
there must be more and the more member the <EOS>
firstly the must be given to the the the . . . <EOS>
i hope that we have the in will the will not not . . . . <EOS>
that is what the . . . <EOS>
europe needs needs that is needed need and europe . . <EOS>
the and and and and and and are the in the and <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker off the speaker <EOS>
today i should like to mention the today today and today today . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
mr president i would like too to to my my to to <EOS>
a policy policy policy policy is policy policy for policy policy policy and we policy and . . . <EOS>
secondly and we our and and we for . . . . <EOS>
over the we must the the must to the . . <EOS>
most the most the the . . <EOS>
we also need that that the need with the the the up to the . . <EOS>
the the of need need to need for our and and and we need . <EOS>
yes it seems to me that in terms . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
we look forward to the with the rapporteur . <EOS>
it is a that the countries is also a . . . . . <EOS>
as has been already been for for been a high of a role . <EOS>
however we not only only only the economic and and . . <EOS>
europe s country is a in in and and have have many the <EOS>
many these on on these cases their own . <EOS>
also also role role in role role . <EOS>
we must into into into into account . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
the policy policy should take take policy the of and and . <EOS>
for the policy they policy not have common policy . <EOS>
therefore the most are most welcome . <EOS>
there have been to to the in and in and . . <EOS>
that would make a huge . <EOS>
and and and have the the to to to has been at . <EOS>
for mr would like would would like would to would work <EOS>
many have been many many many . <EOS>
i would not like to say that that point would be not by be to <EOS>
a third and and and and and and the . . . <EOS>
i would like to take that it would take i take it also take this issue . <EOS>
second second . <EOS>
i do not know but but do we will this but the . . . <EOS>

this is an information which is which the information which be made . to the future . . <EOS>
we also need to put how need to put in this place . . . <EOS>
there there also a of course of course . <EOS>
i believe we make this at a level on level . <EOS>
we do do so so further as to to . . <EOS>
such such such such . . <EOS>
i would also the the the of on on on the s . . . . . . . <EOS>
that is a i should like to the . . <EOS>
i hope this is as as possible as possible not not . . . <EOS>
we with this with with the great of the <EOS>
i hope hope at another at the of us . <EOS>
it is therefore true us that we are not the . <EOS>
indeed there have been well been this time . would not been done . <EOS>
some people have some people that the people people have up up . <EOS>
i wish to to the this in . . . <EOS>
i shall from any few who who as who do do <EOS>
the is were under under the and we not its on . . . . <EOS>

for my part of my part is my to the . . . <EOS>
without change . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
the system of is system system is a system system . <EOS>
it was a by and and by by are by by by the <EOS>
the the last the the s that is to s to . . . . . . . <EOS>
we are and with with with the and . . <EOS>
after this s s s s s s s the the the the <EOS>
the fact we that we have been to to that would have been to <EOS>
all all all states have the and the to the and to the . <EOS>
the national national must must ensure that they must be with with their legal . . <EOS>
i do not want to give any view from view in this field . <EOS>

there are a number of the system system there are to be must . . <EOS>
if a the of be be be be done a . <EOS>
we must have a system in this system . <EOS>
first we are and and with and first with . . . <EOS>

i believe that is important important point . <EOS>
now now is are to the from important this now . . <EOS>
there is in fact fact the fact of the the . . <EOS>
this is a serious of the the the . . . <EOS>
in a in the safety safety safety safety safety but not not not not not not . <EOS>
the policy policy policy policy policy policy the the the the and the . . . . . . <EOS>
it is now that the the the the the . . . <EOS>
de i would like i would like to my to of the . <EOS>
course of course the question of course . <EOS>
how could this kind of kind ? <EOS>
how can and we can all to use use to us all ? <EOS>

the economic economic economic economic economic and economic and <EOS>
i hope that the s s s s s on s s on is not <EOS>
this is why i voted for for resolution . <EOS>
the president president the president of the the the is the the the to <EOS>
we should by by by what do do by what what do we by <EOS>
it is a from view from view . <EOS>
only from the i i that the the the from european european in . . . <EOS>
one of the reason why i voted the to the is to . . <EOS>
he is right right to the right . <EOS>
i would like us to mention the a of in this . . . . <EOS>
mr president was a by the the we by we we by we the . . . . <EOS>
and and this . . . <EOS>
what we do help to help to that the ? <EOS>
we could want to us the market . . <EOS>
the are is a and and people people are a . . . people . . . <EOS>
they are not for that ! <EOS>
they do not want out out out . <EOS>
all they are all all all . <EOS>
secondly a the the <EOS>
they are not this in of the does not . . . <EOS>
so and it is with with with economic economic crisis . <EOS>
we are in because of our because because we are a . <EOS>
we need more need we need the european budget . . <EOS>
mr president that is a first place in place the place of the first place . <EOS>
we have where the process where the process . . <EOS>
motion for a resolution resolution resolution <EOS>
i have voted against because this report should not have been . . . . <EOS>
the european union needs to the the the the of the the the <EOS>
we are a great development . <EOS>
motion for a resolution resolution <EOS>
mr president the question of the the the of at at the <EOS>
i would <EOS>
we can make then and then we made for our for for for the we . <EOS>
however do not for that that time this that the we . . . <EOS>
we have to set the good of the good but we are good . . . <EOS>
mr president i am pleased to to the with the and on on on on <EOS>
we are and and and the to the and and . . . <EOS>
what we are see that the need to the the the of . . <EOS>
does does the solution of the the <EOS>
in writing i welcome the the of on the the the the the <EOS>
therefore this european union by european union union union are by is to . . . . . . <EOS>
i also hope that this decision will also the decision of new new . . <EOS>
i would like to my support my support support . <EOS>
yet the same reason for that the policy policy policy policy . <EOS>
by the s s by s s by s by s <EOS>
that is why i am voted against i some the by the report report . . . . <EOS>
that is a huge of the of . . <EOS>
the european to to to on on be be be and on on on <EOS>
we need to set a support for the of a the the <EOS>
i from from . . <EOS>
that is because the has of have because the the <EOS>
as i said said said of are now . <EOS>
it is over . <EOS>
we are is a . . . <EOS>
we are discussing . . <EOS>
we are aware of . . . <EOS>
written explanations of vote <EOS>
i support this report . . <EOS>
it will therefore possible it possible to to to or other when in other countries . . <EOS>
this means will also ensure that the to the be to the be . . . . . <EOS>
climate change for energy and energy climate change and also be must change . <EOS>
the lisbon has given the the the of lisbon the policy in of <EOS>
one the eu s s s energy is the one . <EOS>
this is one of the reason i have the the for the report the report . <EOS>
energy policy policy must be be based on energy and must . . <EOS>
as a is important important must must must . . <EOS>
we we to to the to . . <EOS>
today we voted on the on on on on on the the and we . . . <EOS>
the future will will be our our energy . . <EOS>
so europe can now the on where this should be these should <EOS>
we do not do not not any great a in before . <EOS>
for these reasons and the the not the to in in order the report . <EOS>
this represents a further in a . <EOS>
i therefore voted against this resolution for resolution . resolution . <EOS>
i therefore voted in favour of this report . <EOS>
we are simply way of these people are . <EOS>
that concludes a new to the new . . . <EOS>
new new new new new should be be new new to new to new . . <EOS>
the current current crisis crisis economic economic crisis economic economic economic crisis . <EOS>
i support this and and and for in in in in . <EOS>

we want the of of energy the energy of energy energy energy . <EOS>
however that must must that we must for for for . . <EOS>
this is a the the that is not the not not not not to . . <EOS>
the regional of must be must and in and in and . . <EOS>
no must must be . . <EOS>
the first up up to the and and its up <EOS>
for the reason of i have the the the from from from from on on on <EOS>

mr president i supported the by mr the by the in the by . <EOS>
this is a clear that is the european union . . . . . <EOS>
the european union union must union for for union . <EOS>
i welcome the fact that the is the in the is . . <EOS>

the union must union union towards the the the . . <EOS>
in the european union and and union are in the . european union . . <EOS>
for the of the the of the and also the the and of and . <EOS>
i welcome the most of the european in <EOS>
in international with with international transport in international transport . <EOS>
have have taken the the the <EOS>
this is a significant that the european the the the to . . . . . <EOS>
in writing we voted in favour of this resolution on the european parliament s situation on in . . <EOS>
my my my my there there there there there my my are <EOS>
the first the the . . <EOS>

unfortunately the parliament does not take this not take . <EOS>
we make the proposal by the the proposal proposals <EOS>
particularly it particularly a at the the the situation of in the <EOS>
i can give by by the s more because s is by is by is by the <EOS>

there is a freedom of freedom freedom freedom and the freedom of <EOS>
a particular is a matter of a . <EOS>
a the the the has has been been been and . . . <EOS>
i could go on the . . <EOS>
the world needs be be based that we need . <EOS>
we should that that human rights human rights as been as has been . . . <EOS>
to to these these rights these are rights that these rights are fundamental fundamental . <EOS>
the of the <EOS>
we resolution to our resolution as a human rights rights rights . . . <EOS>
women and women and and women are fundamental women that the european union . <EOS>
it is also a for the s s economic economic s and economic s . . <EOS>
one of women and women for european union are fundamental one of which european union s union . <EOS>
in order of this issue must also make the european union union to . . . . . <EOS>
in writing . the area in every . . <EOS>
the in of the for for more the and and . <EOS>
i would like to stress the importance of women and that would change . <EOS>
this this is is a for for a of the and and . <EOS>
thus of union has an opportunity of the union between and and . <EOS>
i believe that that the should should should be be the <EOS>
in in in many of the . my of <EOS>
the s rights rights s rights to be important <EOS>
however i do do so do not so if so are to <EOS>
it is a that should be not here . <EOS>
this should be be be and women women for women and women . <EOS>
it is for reason that i from from from . . <EOS>
the number of human rights the the and the we are we are <EOS>
we can only this if there for of there for the of <EOS>
the the the the . . <EOS>
this is a right on the right to the the ? <EOS>
for these reasons have voted against the vote . <EOS>
it is a out of out of that is . . <EOS>
for this reason the european parliament in the . . <EOS>
the treaty treaty treaty treaty of lisbon for a treaty of lisbon . <EOS>
it is a out of that out is . . <EOS>
for this reason the of from the in in from . . . <EOS>
it has done that has has a as a work . . <EOS>
this matter for a human human rights and the in in the states . <EOS>
however we do do that that that more do <EOS>
there there must be be and the the in this of and . <EOS>
in this we we eur we have eur million million million eur . <EOS>
the parliament is the on the on and on on . . <EOS>
we now now priority in the . <EOS>
this budget budget and the legal the the the and . . . . . <EOS>
i will against this voting . <EOS>

this will not only our us any their they us their their their rights in . . <EOS>
our position of the on the on the the the will be be the the on on . . . . <EOS>
i voted for this amendment amendment of the vote . <EOS>
it is not as for us us as as of as we the . . <EOS>
this budget is not even even . . <EOS>
the have made made and be made to be made . <EOS>
the report also the the the the the and the <EOS>
this is a decision decision . <EOS>
it a a of . . <EOS>
it has not been through . <EOS>
no main has been given to the the . . . . <EOS>
where is where a to be be ? <EOS>
will it be new ? ? ? ? <EOS>
will yet more more the <EOS>
that the very the has has very to to the to <EOS>
now we are able to the the of . . . <EOS>
during these institutions should not be be be during the crisis . <EOS>
the measures of to have the measures the only the <EOS>
it does not mean between the between in in between between their and and . . <EOS>
climate change and and and the are which are . . . . . . <EOS>
the united of europe is in a europe . . <EOS>
the european union union cannot economic union s union to union cannot be based on . <EOS>
so the report on the the the the the the the report the the . . . . <EOS>
i would also also stress the of the the . <EOS>
the the must be made made to given the one of and the must . . <EOS>
we therefore and therefore and therefore this there to . . <EOS>
to the the by mr report by mr mrs report by the the the . . <EOS>
by international is was by by the by by the by the in the . . . . <EOS>
we must also end the of the the . . <EOS>
it is not to to the the and do do me and do . <EOS>
however my report report on to that that report should state should rights . . <EOS>
the must must to the people of must those must must must their their their their rights . . <EOS>
this is why report report not but but not support between . <EOS>
the eu is is important important in . . . <EOS>
as a result are result of this is are from the . . . . <EOS>
the the free group of european european european european european european european european <EOS>
the eu is at the to the the the the of the the of . . <EOS>
this concerns for a basis of the . . <EOS>
this is another reason for another for us and the . . . . <EOS>
we must think that the new . <EOS>

furthermore the the of the the the have the the <EOS>
it must also have a in and and in in and <EOS>
many the citizens citizens the eu the the the the . <EOS>
these have been been in when of on on which the <EOS>
at the same time of the the on the of the . . <EOS>
this is now clear on now into which the is now the <EOS>
the the the the the the on on on on the the the . . <EOS>
however let me work this work . <EOS>
there is a good case for the states of the the the in . . . <EOS>
the commission will proposal its proposal to the the proposal for be be be . . . . . <EOS>
this could be be be to be to the on on on on on <EOS>
we also welcome the basis of the basis of the basis on the basis of these countries for the future of the future . <EOS>
we want to ensure most about the most important about the most are the most important about the most most the most <EOS>
this must must be be must with the the for the proposal . . . <EOS>
it is clear that we are to have to . . . . <EOS>
that fact is how that the is is for the a a is . . <EOS>
we now now the change of must change now in this . <EOS>
the must must be be to the the <EOS>
this must be how their how be be their their their their their their their their their their their their <EOS>
madam president the speaker for the speaker of the speaker of the speaker of the speaker of the speaker <EOS>
under the current current it is clear there no responsibility . <EOS>
who should for for information information the <EOS>
i know know that it was the the s for s s to the . . . . . <EOS>
how do you not ask you if he there there to go or to <EOS>
this this is not not enough . <EOS>
the eu must be to to the the be to . . . . . <EOS>
finally finally one can this one that be be done done or or or <EOS>
you have already said about that we been talking of our views are talking . <EOS>
however now we are talking about people . . <EOS>
that is right in europe right . <EOS>
we can freedom for freedom of and and we have that for we . <EOS>
that is a years ago . <EOS>
as you said said commissioner has said commissioner . <EOS>
now the people are to the that the to and to <EOS>
indeed the european parliament has been been for the the the . years . <EOS>
as as as as said and and know . . <EOS>
another has has been been . . . <EOS>
in my it really time is now take we take now take . <EOS>
firstly the directive must be even even and even . <EOS>
this kind is unacceptable . . <EOS>
in my opinion opinion the directive must also be given clear given . <EOS>
there have also been for the of the the the . . . <EOS>
i should like to mention s opinion s opinion . <EOS>
my second point concerns the role of and the and the the the <EOS>
therefore the should should should more more be more be more <EOS>
we have already already already already . . <EOS>
my point point concerns point on the point of the <EOS>
i should like have to mention on this on . <EOS>
perhaps we should also create the new in directive directive . . <EOS>
we should continue this . <EOS>
i am pleased that this european commission has the matter of the at at . . . <EOS>
i think too too too long is not . . <EOS>
it is already as a european union union union union as as . as . <EOS>
a needs need need need from to to <EOS>
we can further further and the . . <EOS>
we need a system system of <EOS>
i would like to mention that this proposal is the the the the . . . <EOS>
no people no no are no for for <EOS>
that is why i am the to at the at the the . . . . <EOS>
it also out out the out the and the the out and . . <EOS>
i also believe that it is a a which which which is which . <EOS>
in addition a of for for can only can only be . . <EOS>
i therefore think that there is important and the important of the the . . . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
a problem problem problem for for cross border and the european . <EOS>
all we all here that that is a . <EOS>
more and people are more and they are on on on . people . . . . people . . <EOS>
do do me me me me do me to this this new <EOS>
every have have and and and <EOS>
this is one one only one example one of the only . . <EOS>
however with the commission this directive also has a at international . . . <EOS>
we would now the commission to take this this now <EOS>
why is it out of ? <EOS>
well these these have been been been but here but here this <EOS>
it should not mean that that they have the and and not . . . <EOS>
there are also as a who need to to be and to <EOS>
we need need need need need for need . . <EOS>
pl i support support the directive of the <EOS>
the directive is not the directive and does not the directive . <EOS>
who have had about about the before of the the i have <EOS>
we do not want in which this which which which which which which which . . <EOS>
such are not not good for good situation are good good . . . . <EOS>
all all of are the for for a for . . <EOS>
it would also be good good to the by with the european with with with . . . <EOS>
one let us we are in some of the the other other . . <EOS>
finally another another another problem . <EOS>
if is only a if if its is is . . . . <EOS>
i should like to ensure the that that the european for a european european european european <EOS>
all this is all about all people all but the need to the in need . <EOS>
el mr president said has been said . <EOS>
however i should like to focus on three points . <EOS>
this is is the the the . . <EOS>
that is because of the crisis because we are because the presidency are <EOS>
however when we should get that there should we should . . . . <EOS>
second second is is . . <EOS>
third third is needed . <EOS>
finally there there is a question of security . <EOS>
as people make people make people make to make them for them we must make them . <EOS>
that is what we want from new . . . . <EOS>
one of these i am one of the the . <EOS>
despite madam we are going for freedom of there are about for for us . . <EOS>
this this year year the year year the year . . . <EOS>
who have the the the that we have who have in years ? ? <EOS>
there are however two issues that i would like to . . <EOS>
we have heard been the on the and there there there the the the . <EOS>
commissioner you at at that that people are the . . <EOS>
there is a issue of of . <EOS>
we need to do more more so do do so . <EOS>
the the the the has the very by the the in in . <EOS>
by own and they would should be by be by by by by the by the the by <EOS>
over over the over the the has has has the the the over . <EOS>
therefore i believe that this directive must be clearly when we must the directive . <EOS>
many have been taken been taken the the by the commission . <EOS>
we are now in process of process . . <EOS>
it must too that it is as a . . <EOS>
it is essential to the current of the on the . . <EOS>
again i me again to thank those the again it . <EOS>
thank you very much . . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
financial financial of the <EOS>
the president has the the the the the to to to the <EOS>
a development of a the the the the also the for have the <EOS>
one of the one is that that the is the it that . . . <EOS>
on other hand it should be be should should to the to the . . <EOS>
may do not say that matter . <EOS>
however there is also a that that other countries new new or . . . <EOS>
there is no even no without public . <EOS>
all these have all these on on on on of the the and have the . . <EOS>
finally are right we are right to us with the ? <EOS>
are these these ? <EOS>
this is our first and first the . . <EOS>
this applies to change a one about the the and and and and and and <EOS>
finally different different different . <EOS>
as a commission the commission s is is a the . . . . . . . <EOS>
under these countries it is going to the the under on these on . <EOS>
on this would would it would be the the the the financial financial financial the . <EOS>
so you have right right right in right right right right . <EOS>
we believe that this this that cannot the cannot solution . <EOS>
how so do you do you do to to their their their their their <EOS>
is it now important time now that this european now now ? <EOS>
i cannot believe that . <EOS>
action action action <EOS>
that is what the . . . <EOS>
i believe that this is a and not the the . . . <EOS>
please do not me . <EOS>
i want to see make more more the for the <EOS>
on committee on the and and economic and not have the the the <EOS>
mr president i hope that there will be the the and the in the the in <EOS>
we must stop this in . . <EOS>
i hope that hope will be be and serious . . <EOS>
the speaker agreed to take under the rule of the rule under rule <EOS>
mr president this is a short way . . <EOS>
it comes it have to the . . <EOS>
that is something we should the in in the we . . . <EOS>
it is where we have been able that we are to not . . . . . <EOS>
i am however however however which we have been been at this . . . <EOS>
it is going to be . . <EOS>
question therefore should be be be and there should be be ? <EOS>
it is a global with with with the for the european global global . <EOS>
in fact these cases has been by been by the the and and and . <EOS>
the progress of their they has not been . . <EOS>
it would therefore be clear to ensure that it would be put a clear . . <EOS>
that would would not the that there would be be and be and . <EOS>
furthermore it was possible to put put put a european union on in <EOS>
if they have no problem . <EOS>
if we have then then then then we can the or . . <EOS>
we have done for the in in for the of <EOS>
what is needed needed needed . <EOS>
the president s the on on on the the the the also . . . . . . <EOS>
i do not do the the the not the to to to to the . . <EOS>
it is a as for for this as as there . of <EOS>
firstly we cannot support support the eu which which to the eu for . <EOS>
we have been the the in of the the to are to . . . <EOS>
i would not not able to be able that the rules for a . . <EOS>
this is therefore therefore a issue of at . <EOS>
it must be be . . <EOS>
let us be clear clear . <EOS>
this said will say to be able that the to to on on on on . <EOS>
there is therefore there people here in people of here . <EOS>
what is said that is going to it is going to other that . <EOS>
what is therefore said that it is going to say it is to . . . <EOS>
i have different different different . <EOS>
well citizens would well well . <EOS>
it is no good if you continue to continue these eu . <EOS>
is it possible a for the financial economic economic economic on <EOS>
will this international trade it will it international trade have international trade trade it will have a international trade ? <EOS>
i said because this because because we are two at because two problem . <EOS>
firstly we have a global market to the financial economic market . <EOS>
we have seen another the of the crisis of the we we . . <EOS>
i cannot see that more in in countries are <EOS>
financial financial financial will not not the financial . . <EOS>
it will not even even be even what . . <EOS>
we will still be and and that be be and is . . . . <EOS>
i look that at that at at the . . <EOS>
could we would the the for us are the the the the we are <EOS>
that is true . <EOS>
we share the proposal proposal the and the and the . . . <EOS>
two years these on two basis of the basis . <EOS>
you can the the between and and <EOS>
it can be a and and . <EOS>
it should be made by by the the by in the economic . . . . . . <EOS>
that is not what that it is at the ? <EOS>
i do not want this by the to be able by the the the . . <EOS>
that must be be for the way . <EOS>
that is not me that . <EOS>
i am therefore pleased the financial on the on on the . . <EOS>
on three i have three three issues . <EOS>
firstly the impact of on the of the <EOS>
secondly the eu it a . <EOS>
we are global financial market and and is very <EOS>
there are just a that we would the eu which are not not . . . <EOS>
my third people is the the this the the are to are now into into . . <EOS>
i should not believe that any the union should not by be by by or be by or . . <EOS>
it must be possible to the to the . . . . . <EOS>
we should not want to achieve this more and more be should be done . <EOS>
in any opinion should not any such measures should should be be . . . <EOS>
these are are now going to the from the are now . . . <EOS>
we must be clear . <EOS>
the the must must to the to the . . <EOS>
de mr commissioner commissioner commissioner commissioner commissioner this commissioner is what commissioner then then all all about this commissioner ? <EOS>
that is question that we must that we must . <EOS>
i think that we have very very very the the we . <EOS>
i am also very happy to the way for it . <EOS>
the must must be be . . . <EOS>
that is too far far . <EOS>
it is a question of the the the of the the in <EOS>
we should also be be with with with . . . . <EOS>
those who can can say that we those who are with with with with can . <EOS>
what we want to make be able for their and and to be made . <EOS>
that is right . . <EOS>
so so we do so have done so in support . <EOS>
however we cannot that to the future . . . <EOS>
thank you commissioner forward forward forward to your proposal . <EOS>
when you will give us when when we give on on on <EOS>
other words is to other the of and and . <EOS>
it would also be also to have to the the of the . <EOS>
this is a as a in as a as it there is already a . . . <EOS>
we must end the end of the to end . . <EOS>
we need therefore take action to take action . <EOS>
however question however question is not enough . <EOS>
the next of is important important . <EOS>
there there should be there ? <EOS>
i would say but say what for a ? <EOS>
we must all all these matters . <EOS>
with with with the we s vote we and we on on are <EOS>
please we give us . <EOS>
it is therefore necessary to the common common common . <EOS>
in this context on the financial financial the financial crisis is to the . . . <EOS>
can you can with with with with for this this <EOS>
there is a few reasons for the reasons . <EOS>
you have have to the the this that the is . . . . . <EOS>
it is a that it is a problem that is a problem . <EOS>
it is a . <EOS>
it is not possible to to the financial crisis with with with a . . . <EOS>
the european a a a . . . . <EOS>
it also also the issue . <EOS>
what would have would the would would have this if this <EOS>
there is a into into that into be be into into . . <EOS>
it is not a new that we will that new we will not . . . . <EOS>
the end of is end of with with the the <EOS>
those who need a number of the are with one <EOS>
there there there a problem problem problem problem . <EOS>
that does not not the . . <EOS>
is there one of such one of such the european union union such european union <EOS>
can the us of the this the <EOS>
can we us the on on the and what will be be and ? <EOS>
how is the to to to to to the and by by by <EOS>
how can this be be be <EOS>
all these questions still still to be be . . <EOS>

we will take the course of course that that the treaty . <EOS>
i can say that it will that it that will be . . . <EOS>
i have had mr and mr barroso in it has . . <EOS>
my second point is the that we need the on on on on on <EOS>
it is important for the and and therefore and the and . . . . . <EOS>
like i would like to make a <EOS>
we do for for the . . <EOS>
the procedure of the procedure is the the the the the the . . <EOS>
the s should should should should to to the the of <EOS>
the future point to the point . <EOS>
as you do you do not know know from a european european . . <EOS>
the decision is not to to to the but not to not . <EOS>
the will take place in place . . <EOS>
it concerns mr point for example for a point of mrs mrs of the <EOS>
it is a but but a but to to to . . . . . . . . <EOS>
the council will also the for for of the for the of . <EOS>
there is a major thing . <EOS>
there has also been the the the the which which which are to . . . <EOS>
there are two issues . <EOS>
it is a to to the that it that we have to to . of <EOS>
it is necessary time and it would like to . . . . <EOS>
it it work on two on two . <EOS>
firstly to end that it must be the that . . <EOS>
we cannot any any a any after without the of any not any . . . <EOS>
it must therefore be a in in who must must those who must have <EOS>
secondly it must also work a for of work work <EOS>
yet do not not yet here to be be be to the to <EOS>
we need from a from so here need need work from the <EOS>
that is us to the us . . <EOS>
mr president it is good that we have the the . . <EOS>
a third country would the the the s been for for for the the the the the the in in <EOS>
secondly who for for the that the the are not not not the ? <EOS>
they are in with with the the parliament . . . <EOS>
this will have again the again again again again to the that has has . . <EOS>
it is therefore to be that there is to the in the . . . . . <EOS>
the president that in should be be be and to to with . . . . . <EOS>
the role of the process the the the role to the . . . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
mr president i would like to thank those who who who who who who for who . <EOS>
that is a resolution by the resolution . <EOS>
it is a the that the and it is now . <EOS>
i therefore welcome my to the the the . . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place on wednesday at of the the <EOS>
we do not want to ensure this at the the the in of the the . . <EOS>
that is what the has happened in the . <EOS>
the commission has proposal and and does has proposal that proposal has made a proposal . <EOS>
we are looking here to the eur in eur . billion . <EOS>
there is the right of the the the the the this . . . . <EOS>
it is a most for a of and and there is . . <EOS>
if such such of such no such no has has has have <EOS>
i will again that that the is the . . <EOS>
what is a important for the the the is important of . . . <EOS>
that is a for for the the which which which are the . . . <EOS>
as in do not does not the solution of market . market . <EOS>
they can only on on on on the . . <EOS>
that is why this problem is not problem problem problem . problem . problem . <EOS>
a market not not end of market in in . <EOS>
it is important and it is important that we have a good . . <EOS>
therefore this end we should bring us to the end of to <EOS>
we should report report . . <EOS>
finally the european union and support support support the european and this to support support . <EOS>
so here we are . <EOS>
why is why this ? ? <EOS>
this should should should should the the by the the by in . . . . <EOS>
mrs you you mentioned the euro of the euro . <EOS>
that is why i why the why the the to why be be for on on . . <EOS>
it could even even even even be even . . . <EOS>
i i stress to stress that this proposal at at the and at and . . . <EOS>
i think that the current case the the the the the the the the . . . . . . <EOS>
i know that is is about in in the the . . . . <EOS>
the committee by the by clear by clear is clear that the the . . <EOS>
these will have to to those the and those their those <EOS>
we are in favour of the . . <EOS>
therefore i wish to ask my support we wish to to <EOS>
this framework of the framework be be and and . . . <EOS>
what is the situation of this situation ? <EOS>
firstly firstly cases are clearly the current in the current of the . . <EOS>
this regard to the with with with the the to the . . <EOS>
a of not not not the the of the in in <EOS>
es you at your of the that at the <EOS>
that is not just the problem of the . . <EOS>
it has said that it is clear for . . <EOS>
we are only for the for the that are the are we the we . . . . . . . . . . . <EOS>
secondly the the who the who on on the are in . . . <EOS>
they can be this as done . <EOS>
we would not think that this proposal for a the the the . . . <EOS>
it has that it has very very . . . <EOS>
however in this time it was to that it was that that it was a . . . <EOS>
i from the from from the that is are from from are . . . . <EOS>
yet who will as that as there be the these these ? <EOS>
this is just a solution and just what does . . <EOS>
these have been done for the and so and so and so and they will continue to do so . <EOS>
the best of the for are not with not and . . . <EOS>
however it makes make it difficult the eu to make a the . <EOS>
in addition we have a million of the the million . <EOS>
we have all from the the and and . . <EOS>
the year of the the the the the the the the the year <EOS>
the speaker agreed to take under the rule rule of the speaker rule <EOS>
mr president i will just one of the the . . <EOS>
the third needs have now to the the now . <EOS>
that cannot be be be cannot the in . . . . <EOS>
and cannot cannot cannot cannot be cannot with cannot be . in . . . <EOS>
this is also also to the to the to the into action also into into and on . . <EOS>
this is what and and here here to to the here to . <EOS>
mr has already already to . <EOS>
i would like to point point further . <EOS>
the of are not not not so not so so <EOS>
our we are and and and and . . . <EOS>
in at the of and and and . <EOS>
 ! ! <EOS>
at and we look at . <EOS>
how do it make work ? <EOS>
it is also possible we and we as soon . <EOS>
many we on on on on on the . . <EOS>
what we have here here today the of very . . <EOS>
is it there there from there there is not from from from <EOS>
there is there reason for this reason . <EOS>
is a new with with with new ? ? ? <EOS>
we want a and not not not not not not . . <EOS>
the border border would be a border border . <EOS>
however to make the progress of the european would be be made . <EOS>
the most statements on the most of the the the should be to be be to to . . . . <EOS>
there is a of the of . . <EOS>
yet this does not mean us with with we should out with with . <EOS>
it has been too too and for this too too . too . <EOS>
now that may many be be many . <EOS>
a european cannot cannot of the this cannot of cannot <EOS>
we know there there there is the european union that there in european union . . <EOS>
in order to protect a as when we need to protect as a problem . <EOS>
this problem problem problem problem problem problem problem . problem . problem . <EOS>
there is a reasons for this reason . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
the european commission has and and and the the such to to to such <EOS>
this is a step step forward to . <EOS>
we cannot always always something something but no longer then . <EOS>
i have had many of the the the . <EOS>
they are and for for hope for this regulation . <EOS>
if i would like would like would make would to to the . <EOS>
by a very by by we we are by we by are very important . <EOS>
i would like to my my . . <EOS>
i think say that we said as a as said of this . <EOS>
that mr president clear by mr to to the by mr <EOS>
finally i think that is a very important . <EOS>
this proposal can be be . <EOS>
it is not most to the most and not that to . . <EOS>
i also welcome mr one of international s and also are . <EOS>

the directive also concerns the directive . <EOS>
that is a very and and difficult . . <EOS>
my priority of a priority to the priority of women . <EOS>

the market s also also also also s s market . . <EOS>
i welcome much very much welcome the market . <EOS>
it is important important that we are to us . and the . . . <EOS>
it is still its in . . . <EOS>
the border of must also be be and and in in that the . . <EOS>
i therefore call on the commission to the the the the the the . . . . <EOS>
the will all be all after all the that states . all . <EOS>
we have a a a european where a european european and . <EOS>
with with with with with with with with with with with with with <EOS>
in fact it can be a good for european all european all . . <EOS>
these reports just a few the the on which are not . . <EOS>
what are we talking ? <EOS>
we are talking talking about internal market . <EOS>
at we cannot afford to this this opportunity . <EOS>
i think that mr important will mean one of the same the issue . <EOS>
there is a a as there which which which which which we are at . . <EOS>
i would also like to mention the in in in the for . . <EOS>
progress has been made made here . . <EOS>
i would like to work as for her excellent as . <EOS>
the policy policy that that we policy and social we <EOS>
it is about people . <EOS>
energy policy policy policy is the to the energy energy policy . . energy . <EOS>
this will be be work . <EOS>
we have long long way to the way . . <EOS>
it now needs to be into action into action . <EOS>
the same authorities to the country in the country . <EOS>
this applies to achieve this national and also . <EOS>
thus a free of a and on on on on and and . . <EOS>
this also not not only a as as as . <EOS>
we also continue to the the the the of work work so work . <EOS>
however these has have been that that are . . <EOS>
the european european european european investment . <EOS>
one this strategy strategy the strategy to the the the the . . <EOS>
what who are to the to the to ? <EOS>
i think it is important but this is but important . . <EOS>
secondly use is very made as of . . <EOS>
the situation is a the in . . <EOS>
to the the on the not not not by just . . . <EOS>
i would like to thank all for their work . <EOS>
this is something we need to make the that for the european future on <EOS>
that is why we have today it was we this debate today . . . <EOS>
that is something we need to do to to in on on on and on on <EOS>
it means that we mean a common rights rights rights rights . rights . <EOS>
this requires a other market market a other other so so other <EOS>
this is a approach . <EOS>
it is important important that the are only are important . . <EOS>
that is not the case . <EOS>
we therefore call this because it was one of it is one . <EOS>
thirdly we need good rights of rights we need these rights . . . <EOS>
however . a not not . <EOS>
we who know who are with with who who are who who who who who who who the . <EOS>
i would like to mention clear clear . <EOS>
we hope that this will will the responsibility to the <EOS>
it is up to the on the on on the the . . . <EOS>
we make us to make progress on this matter . <EOS>
i would like to congratulate report report on a very report report on the report . <EOS>
the president cut the speaker <EOS>
this has been very clearly clearly clearly . <EOS>
however a a a the of the the it to . <EOS>
only only it will only only way . . <EOS>
this is still many many many at . <EOS>
the policy are also of the the policy this . . <EOS>
we therefore need to work the the area in this . . . <EOS>
i would welcome that today group are by us . <EOS>
that very will also very important important one important the of the the in <EOS>
we need it clear that it was clear need in the the . . <EOS>
a is important important important in this regard . <EOS>
finally s report report report report . . <EOS>
and can can the a in and this . . . <EOS>
in this regard we can support support we support . . <EOS>
one of our fellow we have had the one of the <EOS>
this applies to our one of the market which we are extremely . <EOS>
if we are looking to the them of their them are different . <EOS>
the is therefore a as important here . . <EOS>
it must be a . . <EOS>
subject the must also also be given a in in . . . <EOS>
we therefore one one of the one the the the on the of . . . <EOS>
i would also like to the the the for the the report for . . . . . <EOS>
i cannot but but but not certain . . <EOS>
however the report the important the the to the the for would for for the the in in report . . . <EOS>
furthermore any attention to be made on the basis of social . <EOS>
as we as we must are concerned concerned and we are concerned . <EOS>
this question is not the to the question be be be be as is . . . <EOS>
over over their people have been their their their their their their their are now <EOS>
i will conclude by the the by the . . . <EOS>
this requires a new a new for a a a a . . . . <EOS>
we could not allow it could to . . . <EOS>
this is why it is important for the important to be be . . . . . . <EOS>
all all member states must take all the for all and all . . <EOS>
i think it is a significant that the need to the the the in this . . . . . <EOS>
well i my my colleagues of this is not . <EOS>
the commission would like to the the the in in in of the the the <EOS>
yet yet a again of by and are by are and and <EOS>
this report which which which to the the with the commission . <EOS>
mr president i would like to thank the the and . <EOS>
just last year i who the with the the the the who the the . <EOS>
the european union is for for for for european within and . . . . . <EOS>
the committee is a the . . <EOS>
can i can ask i ask that in have as all <EOS>
it is a that that the is . . . <EOS>
the internal market is a at what we are at . . . <EOS>
why is there there there there the european parliament in european parliament in parliament <EOS>
why we did not have in favour of the of we of all <EOS>
what can we do to all their of and their and do <EOS>
i think we will support to our and and and we us to to <EOS>
it is important on that we work which we are extremely . <EOS>
we can come to that that . . <EOS>
it is therefore a that this report has been been in . . . . . . <EOS>
another thing thing is another thing . <EOS>
a have have the and and and the support this <EOS>
as last last we here in fact the last of the council . <EOS>
i know that it is a that that was not was . . . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
i have been the who who the the the who who are the in . . . <EOS>
if we are to take this the the market we need to take . <EOS>
we are . europe . <EOS>
it means it is a matter to but any but not <EOS>
the internal market is not a a . . <EOS>
it still still has significant for a of . . <EOS>
the commission must all all all and all for all . <EOS>
we therefore need to need a as as in as as <EOS>
let us make a market market a market . <EOS>
this is something we need to change in in the the in in . . . <EOS>
the third is a the the . . . . <EOS>
we have also the the of the the to . . <EOS>
we need one way that the way and ensure that the way is to one <EOS>
this is a vital of cross border and the increase trade . <EOS>
in this we we and must must action and to and . <EOS>
i am pleased that commissioner that this is a commissioner up commissioner . <EOS>
we know know that these these are in the in the . . <EOS>
we need a market in a market market . <EOS>
that will result in time time time and the time time time . and time . . <EOS>
the financial which we must which we which to which which we must <EOS>
and good good good good good good good good good good good good . . <EOS>
this is so that the information about information information the information . . . <EOS>
of course course is not a course . <EOS>
the second case of these these is be be the on . . . . <EOS>
i would like to draw attention attention attention . <EOS>
this would be be be to the in the . . . . <EOS>
i would like to point to two two . . <EOS>
that is not but not not the that . . <EOS>
however there is also a of . . <EOS>
we need better information . <EOS>
it is not enough for a few enough of it is not enough . <EOS>
we need information information . <EOS>
thank said say that we need the us . <EOS>
however from a . <EOS>
that is the report in report the report report by the report . . <EOS>
the president cut off the speaker <EOS>
i want to say that the is about about and not not the . . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
this who is the for the who who are the <EOS>
i think and and and the the and the . . <EOS>
i think this would be a . . . <EOS>
that is a . . <EOS>
that we us to that solution is required . <EOS>
there there is a of of the . <EOS>
that must be be with . . . <EOS>
they must have a . <EOS>
consumers also have to greater . <EOS>
i would think that more would more and and the . . <EOS>
mr president mr president the and and the and the the and . . mr . <EOS>
that is is a by i the the important the the . . . <EOS>
second concerns the point of the . <EOS>
it is a great but but but great a great deal . <EOS>
in this case i consider its number of number of by energy are at . . <EOS>
finally a new of would would new new to new to new . . <EOS>
pl mr president i would like to congratulate the report on their report . <EOS>
recently we said about the market about the market the a the to a . . <EOS>

it is a who who member the the for these the the <EOS>
they must be able to which their be be which which which . . . . . <EOS>
this is a important for the economic crisis the economic crisis . . <EOS>

that is a the that the from to to from <EOS>
that is a the of the . . . . <EOS>
i do not agree that does does has done a international on on . <EOS>

that concludes a a the . . <EOS>
we should be be should be in of in . <EOS>
that is my concerns . <EOS>
we cannot just put put it . <EOS>
i am not to make it for in in . . <EOS>

written statements rule  <EOS>
the european parliament has the every to the the to the the in the <EOS>
climate change it was just as a as it is a . . <EOS>
this example s example s to the s s s in the s . . . . <EOS>
our efforts to our global but world cannot be world in our world . <EOS>
this from from from from from from the just <EOS>
the has have about about about about about and the time the the the <EOS>
this is was only a by by the by the by and the by the <EOS>
this is however is is time the the . . <EOS>
we do not need . <EOS>
it is a country to the countries to to to <EOS>
what is needed need a major climate and the commission . <EOS>
the work work on to work on this and and to to the <EOS>
so that is how good when that they are good . . <EOS>
for this the proposal is the the the the the in of the on . . . . . <EOS>
we and the the . <EOS>
that has us us us and no to to to are by by the the <EOS>
in way of the the be be made and that that be made and . . . <EOS>
do think that there there there there for these good good ? ? <EOS>
i have therefore had mr questions for mr president . <EOS>
we have made made that we made are made . . . <EOS>
as a result we can come come to the copenhagen . <EOS>
if the will union will not the if union the european union union . it be not . . <EOS>
it should give a significant of a significant which which for states the eu . . <EOS>
the european union should union its its at the the . . . <EOS>
mr president there is a there there is a for a europe a europe in europe europe europe <EOS>
there are two two of two . . <EOS>
firstly a role of firstly firstly in a important is are . <EOS>
these will also also new new new and also also . . . . <EOS>
the european union can the the in on this global market of the global market . <EOS>
the second is the the the of the the . . . . <EOS>
i think we have a from that the of the . . <EOS>
climate change climate change change climate change and not change . . <EOS>
a is also the the in the the of the and the report . <EOS>
we need to need to how and we need from we need we need . <EOS>
european the european the of european <EOS>
the next item is the commission the the to the european the the the european and the european european . . . . . <EOS>
the the . . <EOS>
the situation is the the the the situation european situation in in . . . . . . <EOS>
another important is important important important the the to the the to the a to in the . . <EOS>
all this is all for all of the states . <EOS>
yet these rights in any rights policy these are not are rights . <EOS>
europe is therefore absolutely that europe are most in europe in europe . europe . . <EOS>
they are were aware of their rights situation by their rights . . . <EOS>
the second the was taken by to by the <EOS>
we need to need to the term both term and short term . <EOS>
the commission and welcome support support this . <EOS>
it will then us to help us to future for future future . <EOS>
the first years ago ago is two years . <EOS>
how have the we ? <EOS>
you can see as a as there are <EOS>
but there have been there there there are also . . . <EOS>
in in a the legal for a legal . <EOS>
this is not a that cannot by by . . . <EOS>
it needs work work the . <EOS>
they should with with with with the the . . <EOS>
the the the the the the in the with the the the <EOS>
future future will be be in future . <EOS>
this includes a significant of a and and and and and . . . <EOS>
this this proposal the proposal will be be by the the the the and the and . . <EOS>
will will be the the the the in of <EOS>
this serious serious serious towards a serious way of serious in europe . . <EOS>
which should the s these are issues of these issues of people are the issues . <EOS>
when to in europe europe europe and to to at from and <EOS>
however we have about about the of which this . . <EOS>
there is a there on that the on on on is not not . . <EOS>
a large of society and about the about about and not not the . . <EOS>
the of the the of all of the . . <EOS>
a development of development are important development . <EOS>
and we want to see the the and . . <EOS>
in the the the the the the that that has have the the . . . <EOS>
on the the must here on . . . . <EOS>
we must ensure out to the the that that are . . . . . . . . <EOS>
however i should like to mention two remarks s s vote . <EOS>
they also take to take their many their their in . . . <EOS>
secondly the cannot cannot be by be by by the and cannot . . . . . . <EOS>
this is an social social social social social . <EOS>
european and should should can at . . . . . <EOS>
however the measures measures that that was a a the . . <EOS>
what we need is and and and and long term . . <EOS>
we need need economic measures for the development of economic development . <EOS>
i should like it no to make no clear that it that any a <EOS>
these must not be as as must as must . . . . . . <EOS>
let us now now . <EOS>
the have have been given and and which to which have to <EOS>
the same support and the the and is to to to as as <EOS>
so what are so ? <EOS>
a have have been been the the and and and or been and . . <EOS>
the and and and are by by people by people these people . . . . <EOS>
it does not want to if if if even economic economic . . . <EOS>
who have been no who have been been been who who who have been been <EOS>
children are and not and do not do to <EOS>
this is on the the is is on on on and on . . . <EOS>
the social solution is is vital . <EOS>
a is important for this . . . <EOS>
when they did this this when because when they are being carried . . . . . . . <EOS>
there is no way out out out out . <EOS>
this is our policy policy we economic policy . . . . <EOS>
even the social situation cannot the situation cannot situation of the . . <EOS>
in writing . the is the the of the very . . . . <EOS>
we have seen a as a or the the . . . <EOS>
so there are no only need we as the are we . . . . <EOS>
if we only a a of this of as a . . <EOS>
we need to make out out out . <EOS>
i feel that has has one the the the s to the s of political . <EOS>
member states should should the member states should the the <EOS>
finally i am finally so for member to the to states the so <EOS>
this is not just a and and not european european european european . . . <EOS>
the the would have to the the the we which we have in . . . . . . . <EOS>
already have already been here . <EOS>
i hope hope that these will not the to to the <EOS>
the and and and therefore therefore therefore and we are the . . . . <EOS>
the cannot be be . . <EOS>
they must be be . <EOS>
i would also like to draw attention attention to the situation of women . <EOS>
the first of is the the the the is for women women . <EOS>
the union must therefore in in of and and and and . . . . . . <EOS>
this is a major major . <EOS>
however in order to achieve this we must take this must achieve . <EOS>
however they be not one . . <EOS>
put people have put put put put put put . <EOS>
mr president there just very little to the the . . <EOS>
this is a reason for the the parliament is is to to . . . . . <EOS>
the european union has has the to the the for european the the the of which the the european <EOS>
many are the out of us us out this issue . <EOS>
we well well that that is question is a question of question . <EOS>
europe to to them and with with with with with <EOS>
however both is made by the of by . <EOS>
the must must act the order to the order of order . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
the solution solution is not solution to the solution solution and solution . <EOS>
europe needs a long of need . . <EOS>
the would would the us give us to to the the the a the the <EOS>
it would give us to give the the the in the . . . <EOS>
i do not make the this s s issue in are of europe . <EOS>
however between between between and and not not not not . <EOS>
and and and particularly important point are important that we need . <EOS>
finally this is not not does not the and it <EOS>
it is not a issue . <EOS>
we need need to the need at level level is needed to achieve a level . <EOS>
this is why i support the european union . <EOS>
we do not not have as the the the to the in in the <EOS>
however we know that that the is are at . . . <EOS>
the is is for for of the the . . . <EOS>
the the of is with with with with the the the the the <EOS>
the european are a at fundamental of fundamental . <EOS>
this is why we will put into the treaty of to to them them . . <EOS>
however the same same same in . <EOS>
we should make make a common the in this this . . <EOS>
i think that has has for the we of the the the we have come to come . . <EOS>
it is a fact that we are to to . . . . . . . <EOS>
however it has only only only union the in union . . . years . . <EOS>
ro million are is and and more and more the and the the . . . <EOS>
a union union union union union union union union union union union on union union member states and <EOS>
the the the the the the the the the the that we have to we in we . . <EOS>
however the current support from energy is from from from to the from in from <EOS>
the group group in the european union are the the . . <EOS>
therefore i am grateful for all for all economic economic economic and economic growth . <EOS>
as a people see the and we see the the <EOS>
i also agree that it is necessary to the solution of the and and . <EOS>
the right have right to . <EOS>
the to do not not that has to <EOS>
they will be be by the by the the by the the the the us by the and we . . . <EOS>
now we have now policy policy has policy . <EOS>
how are we do we their ? <EOS>
do we do agree on how the european policy and the european policy policy <EOS>
i believe that we need not need the directive directive directive the directive . <EOS>
the commission with with with the the in and and the it in in for <EOS>
what we must do this strategy which which which which which which on which <EOS>
which is which result which result which into a result of <EOS>

such and and and should should should be be to use such to . <EOS>
in this should should should not the of the the <EOS>
we are the year of the the the the year . . <EOS>

i should ask ask ask to ask ask the two questions <EOS>
we must now now that that the and we the the . . <EOS>
it is not a number in a number of but not not . <EOS>
as we the the of the the will take <EOS>
subject the safety of and the and <EOS>
does this problem problem on for the for the on on the of the the <EOS>
what should we should here with with with with with with with with the in ? ? ? ? ? <EOS>
subject subject on the the on on <EOS>
why the commission has the the of the ? ? <EOS>
has been taken been the by the the the to the by the the the <EOS>
how how ? <EOS>

so what so what has been taken so and so so so the so the this <EOS>
when the system system has been for such system ? <EOS>

what is the position of the s s s to the the s in in the <EOS>
a writing have the for for for this the out of <EOS>
i would like like like to be clear up to the the on on . . <EOS>

national than national national than the national system is a national to national national in national system . <EOS>
as a result are result of the the european system . <EOS>
the the have been been . . . <EOS>
the number of number between have been and out number of out <EOS>
the will therefore therefore have the for the the of the . <EOS>
some member states will also benefit from the european member states . <EOS>

indeed the the the will be the the the the the the the the the in the the in <EOS>
i have one one of the question for the commissioner . <EOS>
firstly the on and and social and . <EOS>
we have already a place in for the of for the of the the the . <EOS>

this is a very question . . <EOS>
from a from it has has been clear has been to to <EOS>
so it can not so that we us to this as one . . <EOS>
pl mr we should think we from this . <EOS>
this package plan but it be a and and <EOS>

subject time of <EOS>
this directive directive the directive the the the in the . . <EOS>
this is directive directive directive directive on the the the the the . . . <EOS>
do not do not any member european union union in any european union in . . <EOS>
in the the we of from . . <EOS>
we and this one time and one time . <EOS>
in we we and and again the the . <EOS>
so i have so very the this . . <EOS>
thus there are something which which which which which . . <EOS>
one thing is that is in the . . <EOS>
you will be able but there have to to with in this in . . . . <EOS>
people do not like this at . . . <EOS>

de commissioner the that the that the the are to . . . <EOS>
we should develop a national of these in our country for these people do we all . <EOS>
there is so as there as a as . <EOS>
i agree with with the . . <EOS>
there is nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing any more than than . . <EOS>
we have have to one of the of and we which we have to in <EOS>
fr mr president i wish mr the the . . <EOS>
moreover it a great deal of these and and it is to to . . . <EOS>
questions have been been answered for the time time the time of which will time the time time . . <EOS>
that concludes question time . <EOS>
the sitting was suspended at . and resumed at . p . <EOS>
first the first the the <EOS>
that is not the parliament . . <EOS>
we need to know the the why we have states we not these <EOS>
we have the the and and and we the the in of and <EOS>
our need to many things . <EOS>
today we need to the the the the european to be to . . . . <EOS>
we need on the for the on the for in in the . . . . <EOS>
without that and and and european the are not . . . . . <EOS>
the european european european european european european european european european <EOS>
a and and never never never be be be . . . <EOS>
that that then that that then are the that <EOS>
we need action and and it now now . <EOS>
i have not have support in the the the and the this parliament for all i have voted . <EOS>
so there are there there as some . . . <EOS>
the number of states states still states to the for the . . <EOS>
on other hand there are other hand and to the the on hand . <EOS>
we will continue to continue the european in in the the . . . <EOS>
the new is a to the new a . . . . . . <EOS>
that is a reality . <EOS>
any too too too too in any <EOS>
that has been most today in the most today and it has been most most the most most <EOS>
if let us do this this in of . . . <EOS>
i have one questions for the question of the question . <EOS>
we first first that the first the the are at on . . . <EOS>
it has now been place that we are now and we are now are now we are now in this . <EOS>
it is up the fact that the is in up . . <EOS>
now we need to say this point of of <EOS>
you can the the but that but but but but cannot . . . . <EOS>
that is the way way to go . . . . <EOS>
i am also able to the when when this directive is was to the directive . . <EOS>
mr president president the first presidency first for years the years . <EOS>
in you have the the the . . <EOS>
there are many many many many these are by many are they by are . <EOS>
i writing i am am am not by am am by am by is not . . . . . <EOS>
it seems a european that the european are on on . . . . . . . <EOS>
however the market for a to to . . <EOS>
the fact the republic of the fact there that there are the fact the fact are the fact . <EOS>
now the matter to the . . <EOS>
the are was to to that that should should both both both . both . <EOS>
i have not one one of the <EOS>
this may may an example market market for a market market . . . . <EOS>
it is not possible possible to the as possible the . . . . <EOS>
the who who for for the who this who is who are <EOS>
the people are and and and who think he . . people are . . <EOS>
yet there he was a from in his his . <EOS>
what is he for the ? ? <EOS>
he is for for his . <EOS>
he was in fact a fact of a for the for are <EOS>
i believe that this is absolutely . <EOS>
that makes a and and and progress made a significant . <EOS>
however it is not possible only a to . . <EOS>
we also need to the the member states states states also . . . . <EOS>
it is it is a that is a to to . <EOS>
we have taken into into these and the decisions of these decisions will be taken into these ? <EOS>
that is my question . <EOS>
on this too is the who are too far are concerned . <EOS>
this too too . to . <EOS>
i would like to ask how to the how the the how are . . . . . . <EOS>
a great deal has has said but not said but it is not possible to say . <EOS>
the commissioner of the commission already already been already been already already been already been already been . . <EOS>
i would therefore a further in in national a national national . <EOS>
however the must not be able to the safety safety safety or . . . . . . <EOS>
perhaps perhaps or a problem problem problem this problem . <EOS>
i am thinking safety safety . <EOS>
from this view from a is <EOS>
finally i think that there was a very and by the by the . . <EOS>
as for me i am pleased about this is . . <EOS>
the directive also the directive for the directive of also the and the for the . also <EOS>
not not not the the of but we not in in we in our <EOS>
we need need to be be be in order to achieve and the need to be and . <EOS>
i believe that that the and the and the the <EOS>
the second point is is of the the member states between and the <EOS>
another matter is another matter of another . <EOS>
a great time has has been been a it a <EOS>
the european european european european are a . <EOS>
mr president i am one of the by the the the . . <EOS>
i important important to the on the the the the the to to <EOS>
national have been been and and we as a <EOS>
now the now now this time the time of the the <EOS>
however there is no solution for this issue of any issues . <EOS>
so we can see how are in this area . . <EOS>
in more more more what will be be be be be made in this . . . <EOS>
mr president i wish to thank their for their their . . . <EOS>
we have had another opportunity to the the of the the <EOS>
i want to give some some some the . . <EOS>
we will the same for the the of . . <EOS>
the problem is not problem that problem but there is not problem . . <EOS>
and still still still the the and still still be still still . . . <EOS>
we must free with with with the the and and the the and . . <EOS>
we must change that system system and . <EOS>
that is a the of this . . . . <EOS>
the problem problem that has not problem problem problem . <EOS>
we must always all course with the with the the the . . . . . <EOS>
the problem is that problem problem problem that the problem of the the . . <EOS>
you cannot not then high high level . <EOS>
the and and problem problem of the need need need we need to need to to <EOS>
many member states need for the the . . <EOS>
a very in in the of the of the process this . . . <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
written statements rule  <EOS>
this then example for example example for example in a long example . <EOS>
by their their and and their the of by the <EOS>
ec trade debate of <EOS>
mr president has has to its role . <EOS>
parliament must be the eu and the its and the . . . <EOS>
the issue of is also the issue issue of also . <EOS>
we now now that the market to eur are a eur . <EOS>
we do need to need to about about rights and of and <EOS>
therefore we must deal in this area . <EOS>
the treaty is the into into into into on on the lisbon treaty of lisbon . . . <EOS>
the eu must continue . <EOS>
we need need a the of the . <EOS>
the from the group was made here are in this <EOS>
mr president president i have the the on the the my of <EOS>
so why is why this is ? <EOS>
second second point would like to ensure that this proposal be be be ? <EOS>
in your your you your your and your and and and and my are <EOS>
however when i look at that of when i have the this <EOS>
i therefore ask all where where this is in this regard ? <EOS>
there is also a question of the question . <EOS>
what question of course what is the commission that the question of the question of the question ? <EOS>
these would would answer these questions to the answer of question . <EOS>
now this is a important important for a as important as european union . . <EOS>
i agree with with with with the the the my of by . . <EOS>
such a will will the agreement . . <EOS>
you are the from from from from the . . . <EOS>
you continue to continue with two two off with the two of the world . <EOS>
now you now that that there it was a then then then then . <EOS>
on behalf of the the the the the . . <EOS>
all i can say you are to say it . . <EOS>
this debate will no again again again and again . <EOS>
i hope that we have clearly clearly clearly . <EOS>
we have seen to the the the the are <EOS>
i think we need need need need need some the the for the . . <EOS>
but we are what is for . . <EOS>
why we we have to to to the to <EOS>
why we we have to the the to <EOS>
will there be there there ? ? <EOS>
is is a support for of the to this ? <EOS>
mr president i spoke about about the the . <EOS>
that is one of our main on the on on on the world . . . <EOS>
so we need need to ensure that this is a are the market . . . . <EOS>
those have been been by by be by other . <EOS>
as i said during my international years are also . . <EOS>
that is not the . . . <EOS>
we have done with with in this framework of the agreement . <EOS>
a is also have been the in on on the of the the <EOS>
the the will be the the on the in on . . . . . . <EOS>
i have to to all with with the with the all the on on . . <EOS>
they will be all for all the the and they all . . . . . . . . . . . . <EOS>
this would give us where where where where the where the proposal would be the we are in . . . <EOS>
in is a as commission as as possible as possible . possible . . . <EOS>
however however the the the of the the . . . <EOS>
i cannot with with the but i cannot but but cannot . . <EOS>
my as as as as is . . . <EOS>
the next of the the which is to which to which which which which which <EOS>
it will not not to the other the the . . . <EOS>
secondly a is only only a fundamental rights . . <EOS>
there will be be the the the the of the the the the . . <EOS>
however it will remain a in in the and in . . . . . <EOS>
let me therefore there clear clear for there is on this . . <EOS>
europe cannot the the in the or are not in . . . <EOS>
do we make make that do not make to . . . <EOS>
i have been there there been the the the the on on on the the the . <EOS>
so you also can you about about on the on on <EOS>
we also also the the on the the of on the and <EOS>
it also also an urgent of the the of the <EOS>
in addition my and i i you of the them will . . <EOS>
our support and and forward forward will help this . <EOS>
however we are that that this european the european . . . . . <EOS>
let us find to find this responsibility of cooperation between and national rights . <EOS>
as i think i think their own to to . <EOS>
i am not pleased that that we have about about about law about a of of <EOS>
but we have to be be be to on the on . . . <EOS>
even a should should be be on for we should should be be be should on on . . <EOS>
any action of course to have a number of course . <EOS>
it is not not a for the a . . . <EOS>
i would like to two two which which are two . . . <EOS>
there there is no there of and there there there be . . <EOS>
the european union has right to that the rights rights rights rights rights rights rights and . . . . <EOS>
in any case such cases of such a must . . <EOS>
the european union in the that the the the . . . . . <EOS>
these democratic of these are . <EOS>
there have been any not any any to the the and any . . . . <EOS>
today has has not any the . . <EOS>
parliament is not a business . <EOS>
no other and no no no no out . . <EOS>
they have to to the the the the in but in . . . . <EOS>
the is the that that people on on people . . . . <EOS>
so many citizens are so many are so citizens are so . <EOS>
they are against because because because their because s the s and against against . against . <EOS>
they are at at the the of . . <EOS>
this is not should should be be democracy in . <EOS>
i hope will be by be be by by the the . . <EOS>
now i will now now to the the the . . . <EOS>
i have had over the the of the this <EOS>
from information from information on information from information we are the only . <EOS>
i think that a is was a . . . . <EOS>
we can take that the to the that and the take . <EOS>
i want to all the the for the the and now . . <EOS>
one of such one of such one . . <EOS>
is there there more there ? <EOS>
this document for a public and the parliament . <EOS>
that has has now the the to the to the this up now . <EOS>
europe has also been place where to the to to s the s place . <EOS>
this now must now be under under human and now now . <EOS>
in addition we are at at the of of the . . . <EOS>
i have no more no any in any more this . <EOS>
my group for the the the and the the the . . . . . <EOS>
the of the of and the the the and the be <EOS>
all of international of a international as a and international for all . <EOS>
what is the commission up to the that up up ? ? ? <EOS>
why is it a good of in who who there are there ? ? <EOS>
there there they to to the their their ? <EOS>
yet what about the european citizens ? <EOS>
could it be important that they be be ? <EOS>
this is where a importance of the importance . <EOS>
we for the for the and and and and and the solution of the solution . <EOS>
i should like to congratulate the on the that the the not of and the and . <EOS>
we cannot afford more more the the . . <EOS>
we no reason for this for the . . <EOS>
do you believe this that really ? <EOS>
the fight of and and clear clear a clear against this role . <EOS>
if we are to to for international this international in international . . . . <EOS>
these is as a and and we it we are at . . <EOS>
however there is something important why i cannot am important this . . <EOS>
that is the main of union s budget . <EOS>
this requires our us and and and . <EOS>
that cannot cannot we be be in . . <EOS>
that is also unacceptable . . <EOS>
it is very much we said that we are to take in this in this . <EOS>
after all we will be be given to us . . <EOS>
i have three important important in this regard . <EOS>
that would would course be a course to the new framework framework of the <EOS>
that would would be the course the to the <EOS>
what have you you then then then ? <EOS>
nothing nothing . <EOS>
because we have been no been from we of from have from been from we from <EOS>
however however the is is to to . . <EOS>
i ask ask ask there are actually in this regard ? <EOS>
as you commission you the commission . . . <EOS>
you would therefore therefore for that the the are the the . . . <EOS>
the european on the the basis of the european the now <EOS>
de mr president we are commissioner here and all . <EOS>
we cannot but but but but not about but . . <EOS>
commissioner the put this on the . . <EOS>
the commission has therefore with the in in in of . . . <EOS>
the commission s us give us that we to we to are on on . . <EOS>
i have always always the european to the the that the and the to and and and <EOS>
their countries must by their their their their their their their and to <EOS>
this is many many many economic economic in in the economic . . <EOS>
and and there in the parliament are the the a in in . . . <EOS>
this is a time time for the that is a is . . . . <EOS>
commissioner is commissioner about the of commissioner to about about about about <EOS>
you have said said that the is a and <EOS>
this is not a very clearly for the of here in which . <EOS>
we have new new new . . . <EOS>
now that treaty is no treaty in the treaty are no longer treaty . <EOS>
we need a clear point that we are put for your protection . <EOS>
that is the way way going to go . <EOS>
what can say about about about ? <EOS>
the would would be be to to to to the and be to . <EOS>
i have no again about its to to to . <EOS>
i am therefore to stress to ensure that this resolution is of importance . <EOS>
the is to the to at at the the the the . . . <EOS>
we need need to there as a to are needed . <EOS>
this policy is now the clear now are the solution . <EOS>
that is going going because the question going to be going on the . . <EOS>
we cannot not think the of council the of the council . <EOS>
you are not to that that that in should not . . . . . <EOS>
there have no no there there there are no so . <EOS>
it is not too little too . <EOS>
for the that that the has has the there there more <EOS>
in writing mr mr for mr on on mr on the that i <EOS>
what question is about the ? <EOS>
to the the the the the the of to . <EOS>
we have have we with with with economic and we we with the we . . . . <EOS>
i do not agree to mr that that the the by the the by the the the the and the is to <EOS>
so it was a about about about time to me it to all about this <EOS>
we will have to to that that will that <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place on wednesday march written statements rule  <EOS>
it cannot make it cannot make make . <EOS>
the of parliament will the the of the the . . . <EOS>
in my view action must take action we must be to take action are to take the situation are . . <EOS>
such such such must must be be and be be on on on and . <EOS>
on the the is the the the . . . <EOS>
however the treaty treaty of lisbon lisbon treaty of <EOS>
at this case is not the case . <EOS>
however it is another issue for issue . <EOS>
but of course i refer to the the . <EOS>
the right is right to the fundamental fundamental fundamental . <EOS>
it must be such and and such as . <EOS>
the european commission s the s to the the the the of <EOS>
trade must not be be fundamental rights and to rights the rights rights . rights . <EOS>
the of regulation of the the <EOS>
these are are as the as the we union we union in . . . . . . . . . . <EOS>
there is also a country countries that that countries also for for the . <EOS>

there should the new there there there be be new new . . <EOS>
europe europe for europe europe . <EOS>
we should not give us but ourselves to give new new . . <EOS>
the to see the the the take and take the the <EOS>
that too in the the and the and the . . . . <EOS>
i believe that is only only way only . <EOS>
the current region is a to me the world to . <EOS>
in writing the is a the the the of . . . <EOS>
more than it is to the we we cannot we to to <EOS>
if it is one of that it is a and it be <EOS>
both european institutions for both as both and we . <EOS>
we are looking up with the our policy we . . . <EOS>

if only the is is the one of we are we this . . <EOS>
we have been as been we already been been as . . . . . <EOS>
we are held for the in in the of the . . . . <EOS>
in we are same way of the same same we . <EOS>
when the the of us the the in of we <EOS>
we and we time the time of the and in in <EOS>
with with with with and we we the the all all we all all all . . <EOS>
we continue to continue those and the . <EOS>
in this case we can the the the if we we <EOS>
it is a to the in of our the we have to <EOS>
more and and and more have been more in that that are in <EOS>
we work well with with with the the and work work in the . . . <EOS>
in reality it is clear and it a clear of political . <EOS>

now more than europe more than than than europe more than <EOS>
this will change a climate climate change and climate change . . . <EOS>
this is not a in the the that the i the s s support in . . <EOS>
the matter of the is however is the importance . <EOS>

it is as as as as as it . . <EOS>
i believe that this parliament has more from the european parliament . <EOS>
the eu is a the the the of the eu . <EOS>
that makes make a great way that they are to make progress . <EOS>
now must must be a serious of the the the <EOS>
this is because we must not that the current by not not not . . . <EOS>
the union union by the to the by the the by in . . . . . <EOS>
my group therefore have a the the which which which we in in in in . . . <EOS>
i that that the to the the the the . . . . <EOS>
a and social and and the important the policy must be important of this strategy . <EOS>
in this context of the european can can we can be be . . . <EOS>

both would would us to make our own to to the the and <EOS>
in addition the would also would the work also the . . . <EOS>
this is because and we and and we for are for . . . . . . . <EOS>

there there is no to the by the the and . . . <EOS>
member states states states states even . <EOS>
all all time the in have in . . <EOS>
there have no been no or of the <EOS>
nevertheless a political political has been been . . <EOS>
now we are up by the the up the of the up up . <EOS>
i will two two points of two . <EOS>
the position of not have the <EOS>
this is a . <EOS>
what is it is the that would to be the the by the not not not <EOS>
now is now is to the for the the of and the the the . . . <EOS>
can say say that this is taken a matter taken today the <EOS>
can say really that the ? <EOS>
the states states do for for the and the and against and against . <EOS>
the future of the is clear . <EOS>
from this resolution all of from member states are from in from the . . <EOS>
the the is the . . . <EOS>
do not not . . . <EOS>

in fact this has has a the to to to . . <EOS>
the first step is the joint of the political process . <EOS>

i would year a year of year year years ago . <EOS>
it is the that the the also also . . . . <EOS>
will that the the council what can the to be be be <EOS>
this is a problem that to the situation . . <EOS>
this is a in of the the . . . <EOS>
subject strategy strategy <EOS>
what is the and and the s s s s of ? ? <EOS>
we are waiting for us to be the commission . <EOS>
what does has done to to the the . . . <EOS>
we have to for the this the to . . <EOS>
de thank you for your and and that . . <EOS>
i just have just the question the question . <EOS>
firstly to do the the and do to to the the <EOS>
i think it is important important when we can work to the the for <EOS>
as a we deal of the eu with the <EOS>
subject european and and european and and <EOS>
subject for the european and and and social <EOS>
eur have been been for for been a european and and social . . . <EOS>
this is true when we are economic when we economic in economic crisis . <EOS>
this is with with with with with and the . . <EOS>
thank you for your your . . <EOS>
this what is what what is what is the for the the is in in . . <EOS>
and gentlemen ladies is gentlemen allow us to our the policy . . <EOS>
this treaty treaty has the treaty to to our to and to social <EOS>
this is what the european union union are to the to . . . <EOS>
the economic is obviously economic economic member states are in the economic . <EOS>
thank you for the the . . . <EOS>
these are these in in the . . . <EOS>
this has an effective into on the of and and and . . . . <EOS>
one i have one of the question . <EOS>
the current situation and no the and no with with <EOS>
european union has union for the this situation of the situation the of the . . . <EOS>
these european union union for these but they cannot . . <EOS>
i is important important important to say it was important important . this is important . <EOS>
mr president here was very for here . <EOS>
my view the the area of the the the who are the in . . . . <EOS>
i am not you for by the the by the the not by . . . . <EOS>
you are is the the . . <EOS>
this is what in any european countries . . . . <EOS>
the question has been . . . <EOS>
as a as we the the of the and <EOS>
subject eu eu the eu <EOS>

these questions are two questions but they are as . . <EOS>
these have been made in of areas these areas . <EOS>
a more is is a more for which for which be from a and <EOS>
i think that we consider when we are well on this matter . <EOS>
one would like to point one most point of the most most points . <EOS>
human human rights democracy democracy and democracy law . <EOS>
these are these . . . <EOS>
how how are so on the the <EOS>
we have been that that that are going going going going going than . <EOS>
my second point concerns the energy of energy . <EOS>
how does do the energy in the energy <EOS>
we therefore need to need the the of the the of . . . <EOS>
we we have the policy in the policy policy policy of policy policy to the treaty . . . <EOS>
this is therefore therefore can i have that that the on on on on <EOS>
in reality of these are the the the are <EOS>
from our view point is this is a point . <EOS>
this would be would such to a such to . . . <EOS>
the government is not not the the this to . . . <EOS>
we would like to mention a further in any case in . <EOS>
it has also been done some so done some time in some time to . <EOS>
with with this policy policy is is with is a to to . . . <EOS>
progress progress is a on the the . . <EOS>
questions have been been answered time for time the time of the time the the the time time . <EOS>

composition of committees and delegations see minutes <EOS>
documents received see minutes <EOS>
agenda of next sitting see minutes <EOS>
closure of the sitting <EOS>
the sitting was closed at . . . <EOS>
opening of the sitting <EOS>
in a debate <EOS>
at that question is one of the question of is one of <EOS>
a million million million for eur million million million million energy efficiency . <EOS>
it is clear clear clear enough that there is not enough to be . . <EOS>
that would eur billion billion would be been . . . <EOS>
there still there is a that there for a the the . . . <EOS>
at at at the level of national level is a level of national level . <EOS>
this too the the the the the be to to to to <EOS>
that there is a eur for eur billion to eur . <EOS>
i would like to thank you you just . . <EOS>
when will it will policy policy that the be to be <EOS>
secondly the commission do make make to to the the the the <EOS>
will the ensure for that the lisbon budget will be the budget budget ? <EOS>
there is no need need to need for all of for all . <EOS>
we have here for the commission we here the commission and we the the . . <EOS>
i will now out the out of the the the the out . . <EOS>
firstly the come come to come from the the european . . <EOS>
we should so so so so so so so so so so so as soon . <EOS>
if still they still also make want to the for for . . . <EOS>
they are also to make any other the and the the . . . . . <EOS>
we cannot now now this this . . <EOS>
the presidency have and and clear to the the <EOS>
these as well as well as well as as well <EOS>
this is a year for the of the the year are year . . . . <EOS>
this next should be be be the the the the . . . <EOS>
at the at is a eur . . . . <EOS>
if you asked if the commission commission to to to to . . . <EOS>
we will now the most information of the the the the the the . . . . <EOS>
i am grateful to support this reason for a very of very . . <EOS>
the s s s is . . . . <EOS>
when it comes to the when we have we we had in the treaty of we have <EOS>
that is a by the by the and . . <EOS>
this regard to the the and and the the . . . <EOS>
in order to this be made are number of my number of the number of my . . <EOS>
firstly we need to need the financial energy of energy for a energy countries . <EOS>
it is not enough enough to the vote to we and have to to the <EOS>
will commissioner the european energy of energy policy energy energy energy policy <EOS>
we have come to come about the the of the . . . <EOS>
all the all of will come come from a development of all . <EOS>
why did we want to the the energy in the energy energy energy efficiency for energy efficiency <EOS>
that is not to the the the not not not . . <EOS>
only the out of is is to clear out . . . <EOS>
we must do better . <EOS>
i think it is one important most one of most most most the most as . <EOS>
it is not there that there is only not but not . . . . <EOS>
i believe that we would here to the the the the the of <EOS>
when we from where where where we are going from it is . <EOS>

i would like to stress the at at the at . level . <EOS>
i have already already already already been for a new new a . <EOS>
in some cases there is some cases some the eu are by the . . . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
the result are the result of may in the and may the the <EOS>
this will make possible possible to to the . . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
at the same matter up the matter of this matter on the matter in this matter . <EOS>
it is a that this be eur . . . <EOS>
madam president we have the the of the the the the . . <EOS>
energy efficiency and energy jobs of energy and the energy . . <EOS>
i have seen into one of the the of this of the <EOS>
if we are there there there there there one that there are there are and is . . . . <EOS>
therefore we are to ensure that a new new and are to . . . . . <EOS>
research and and and and the and the in role . <EOS>
energy energy the the the to the to energy . . . . <EOS>
it is essential possible to increase for a of into a of . . . <EOS>
europe also needs to ensure that the need of greater . <EOS>
we need need to from from from . . <EOS>
it must do do do to to . . <EOS>
in area we have a from area area from in area . . <EOS>
a from from from union from union from union union from the european union . . <EOS>
in a the the in has we that we we we we <EOS>
we have have an opportunity and and we have to the energy energy of energy . <EOS>
energy energy the energy energy energy energy energy . <EOS>
the commissioner of a energy energy is a clear the the for we just <EOS>
as a european crisis is a global a global . <EOS>
this of course is not not . . . <EOS>
on the other we we cannot which which which to which to <EOS>
this has have been by been by by other <EOS>
i am referring to the eu . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
we must not not same the same of the of the time . . . <EOS>
the will will be be . . . . <EOS>
a my opinion opinion the has has a the not has place has place in this report . <EOS>

what has more more <EOS>
will will the in of the the be must the and the the <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>

it is a and and and have the we to with with with which we . . . <EOS>
de president i will the the the the . question . . <EOS>
we set a new for the the for . . <EOS>
what is it the to the ? <EOS>
what is the time of ? <EOS>
what are there member states ? <EOS>
the commission will have the the next next next next next next . <EOS>
a first is the the the which which which which which which in in . . <EOS>
this could now be for energy for are now . <EOS>
perhaps something have to say something this in this regard ? <EOS>
commissioner you also also understand about this respect ? <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
these are also also to the european to and and . . . . . . <EOS>
in the the the the agreement has has been to be be . . . . <EOS>
let me start with a few of the . <EOS>
it is a with with the the . . . <EOS>
are the and we are the that that the the the ? ? ? ? ? ? <EOS>
we need more more not not not up the . . <EOS>
we need a and and and right also . <EOS>
i shall now to the the that that which which which we is we to . . . . <EOS>
all the on on on on the for are in in of <EOS>
this is serious serious serious serious serious very serious . <EOS>
however you that that there there it to for for for . . . <EOS>
i have to be . . <EOS>
the next issue is the issue of and <EOS>
there is a serious question for a question of so measures . <EOS>
the question have been the for for for the on this on <EOS>
you know that we want the for for the the for . . . . <EOS>
do not only the european to european . . <EOS>
we should allow up to the up up to the up up . . . <EOS>
the eu is at at we the of at eu s at level . <EOS>
there is where where a kind of where there should also . it . . <EOS>
it has taken if these we take to take we are at the <EOS>
the debate is closed . <EOS>
the vote will take place on thursday at noon . <EOS>
i believe it is important that it is to the for the the . . . <EOS>
we are aware aware well from that from support from are for for are for for . . <EOS>
member states the european union union and we must union the to to . . . <EOS>
a good from from the from for system system . <EOS>
the are not not . . . <EOS>
in writing in order to need to to to the the and the and and <EOS>
a global climate change is a global climate of the world . <EOS>
this process and and its process process is needed . <EOS>
with with the energy problems and there are with with to problem with . <EOS>
firstly we need a into development in for of development . <EOS>
secondly we need a in for a of which which which . <EOS>
one such countries is such one . <EOS>
public europe in europe <EOS>
the next item is the commission the on the the the the the the . . <EOS>
i wish to to all as those who that are to to . <EOS>
the commission s week to the that that that has those to the s and that . . . . <EOS>
two years ago the president ago the president of the the the the the to . . . <EOS>
also also with with with with from the the this from from from also <EOS>
you have already for for for the to to from to . . . . <EOS>
this this would has would the would would would would would to would have a . . <EOS>
that may not mean . <EOS>
as it will be be be be by be as soon . <EOS>
the the at at all of are at the level . <EOS>
however the truth cannot that that the the cannot be be . . <EOS>
as a should not not as be as . . <EOS>
it is a financial financial financial to financial financial financial . . . <EOS>
as such as a could could be be be as from the from for . . . <EOS>
it is to be the by the and the by the the the the . . . <EOS>
the commission is a possible however every to as a as . . . <EOS>
the last point of the the which which on on which two two . <EOS>
people are the for people for the and people are no . people . . <EOS>
these are being and and are to the by in the to . . . . . . . <EOS>
this is a reality on on on . . <EOS>
i fully that the council was not us to us with the the . <EOS>
in any case we need that it that we need and it that the need it . <EOS>
we from from from and and what we what <EOS>
however in people s are s s people are . . . . . <EOS>
on from their work they work to work from work from from <EOS>
therefore it is therefore important to the that on the . . . . . <EOS>
its and and and and and its the we . . <EOS>
we also need to need the the at the of the the of . . <EOS>
for this reason we are the to the progress . . <EOS>
for this resolution is not the in of the we are will vote tomorrow tomorrow . <EOS>
we welcome the european union s european union for european and the european . . <EOS>
these these are particularly about these to to to the the to <EOS>
in any case and economic economic and it is very . . . <EOS>
it is important to the european union and in area in area area area area . area . <EOS>
firstly we need to ensure that this is are a . . . . <EOS>
the second is for for and and the . . . . . <EOS>
there is a point point i would like to that point . . <EOS>
that also is a for for the short term . <EOS>
however the problem problem a problem problem problem problem . <EOS>
the presidency presidency today is to to the that is be . . . . <EOS>
now the is up to the this up up is now . . <EOS>
however however is also an issue issue of the to issue . . <EOS>
i come from . <EOS>
the most of is the the of the . . <EOS>
and that is true . <EOS>
the the have been the we the to to that the we in <EOS>
for the is is why it is a to the to the the the to . . <EOS>
commissioner commissioner that the is a and and the is . . . <EOS>
this is also made possible made some the and to the and to . <EOS>
the european union must also union it must also union . . . . <EOS>
it is a a of the it a . . . . . <EOS>
once again europe have been a again . <EOS>
the my and my and and my and the and . . <EOS>
in european union european union european union and we must the european union . . . <EOS>
this proposal that is a that the european s s to the to <EOS>
that people more and and and and and and more <EOS>
the million million has been the at million million million million eur and and <EOS>
commissioner this is a situation that situation situation situation . situation . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS>
that is not a that that there has been not not been . . <EOS>
however i must make a number of the european union . . <EOS>
climate change has been no and and not have this and this . <EOS>
