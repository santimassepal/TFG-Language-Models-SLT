Order business.
By agreement with desc-political group, I would like to propose the following change.
President cut off speaker.
Mr Borghzio, this is not the point of order, since we are talking about the plenary sit.
This is almost without precedent.
I am simply making a legitimate and valid political comment with which ALDE Chair disagrees.
This is why the microphone is switched off.
If the European Parliament censors political comments, it ceases to be a Parliament.
I will reply in writing to the letter you sent me.
Thursday.
So this is about the postponement of the vote.
We have originally agreed to put it on the agenda on the assumption that everything is in order.
Therefore, we ask for the vote on this issue to be postponed.
Welcome.
I have some special information for you.
You are with us at this sit.
Please welcome you.
Applause.
Second Vice President Pan African Parliament and Chair of Delegation for Relations with European Parliament.
We Parliament work closely together, and your presence with us today gives us great pleasure.
I am sure we will have the opportunity to meet again.
Once again, I warmly welcome you all.
Preparation for European Council Meeting 25-26 March 2010 Debate.
However, Europe is meeting this situation by creating a new economic policy tool in all areas.
It is being done in this way, by coordinating economic policy.
There are, moreover, quantified commitments to the so-called fast start.
Heads of state or government will largely be dealing with those matters.
We have challenging tasks ahead.
For those tasks, fresh and forceful backing from the European Parliament is of great importance.
That support is clearly expressed at different formations of the Council of Ministers.
But now, to the European Council, I believe every European Council must do two things.
Crisis entails several pressing concerns for the community, workers, and businesses across Europe.
And, as we know, public finances at the national level are under unprecedented strain.
The European Union must, of course, tackle these issues, including financial stability.
I will come back to this again later.
Europe must not make the mistake of neglecting the imperative work now to bring about long-term change.
We have already debated the Europe 2020 strategy together in this Parliament.
So, too, it will be a contribution to the European Council.
Our level of ambition must be set by the scale of the tasks ahead.
We need to show that we have vision and coherence to act.
This is why I believe it is so important that the European Council agrees on clear targets this week.
The targets which the Commission has put on the table have been carefully chosen.
This is also about the political will to tackle tough problems.
"Of course, the targets must be achievable."
So we cannot accept the principle of interdependence globally and reject it when discussed at the European level.
What we are proposing here is a new departure.
Accepting this approach will be a real test for the European Council.
I am encouraged by the results of the informal European Council.
We need to keep this topic on our agenda.
So let us move on from soul searching about Copenhagen and take the initiative once again.
"We need a clear, unified, and ambitious position."
That is why the Commission has put forward a communication setting out the steps needed to reinvigorate international negotiations.
"At the same time, Commissioner Hedegaard has started consultations with our key partners."
These two areas show vividly how Europe is looking to the European Union for political leadership and action.
Let me therefore state our position on this.
Greece is currently in the process of correcting its excessive government deficit.
Bringing the deficit down vigorously is crucial, and Greece has taken measures to that effect.
It should be clear that the creation of such a mechanism will not imply its automatic activation.
Creating such a mechanism is also a question of responsibility and solidarity.
Solidarity is a two-way street.
The world economy needs stability.
I hope this issue will be resolved in the spirit of responsibility and solidarity.
That is the European way to do it.
Applause.
"To what extent are they willing to cooperate, and what is the line they are unwilling to cross?"
It is in everyone's interest that we guarantee the stability of Europe and the European monetary system.
This responsibility lies with each member state to guarantee accurate and reliable public accounts.
"In other words, yes, Europe must show solidarity with Greece."
It must ensure that Greece comes through this difficult period.
It now remains for Greece to implement it.
"Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis is forcing us to change."
The criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact must be applied, and the Commission must ensure this.
This House will support it in this difficult task.
The second change concerns the governance of our public finances.
Can this continue?
I do not think so.
"Such coordination will not only make implementing the solidarity-based principles easier, fairer, and more natural."
"Mr. President-in-office of the Council, I invite you to take initiative along these lines."
Applause.
"Greece has delivered," writes the International Herald Tribune.
That is the first point.
Applause.
President, the Commission has quite rightly spoken about the safety net.
That is not the objective.
The interest rate is usually 2.5 to 3%.
Applause.
This means people are being robbed.
"Speculators will then turn their attention to Italy, the UK, and Spain."
"If we do not want to see a large-scale conflagration, we need to demonstrate solidarity with Greece now."
It is not just a matter of giving aid for the sake of it.
Applause.
It is the Commission that must propose how we can achieve sensible stabilization within the Euro area.
The Commission has made good proposals, and I believe that the Council should go along with them.
These do not include a call on the International Monetary Fund.
Why not?
We are in a position to resolve the problem within the Euro area ourselves.
"Moreover, I am astonished that Chancellor Merkel is bringing the International Monetary Fund into play."
That is a quote from the German Bundesbank.
That is not the right way to go.
Speculation will not cease until such signals have been given.
This is nothing more than a game of "I will ensure myself against my neighbor's house burning down."
"Should my neighbor's house burn down, I get insurance money."
That is why solidarity with Greece is an act to stabilize the Euro in the Euro area.
Applause.
"I shall go further, Mr. President."
That is my feeling today.
Applause.
It is not about that.
There are two elements that count in terms of interest rate: liquidity and credibility.
The only way to resolve that is to truly take the necessary steps to introduce this European instrument.
That is what will happen if a firm decision is not taken during this Council.
Applause.
That is why Europe must intervene.
Europe must intervene to ensure that Greece's consolidation measures are worthwhile.
"They are necessary, but they must also be worthwhile."
That is what we must hope for.
Yet it is only now that we are debating the terms on which this assistance will be granted.
I think it is disgraceful.
Applause.
The state of Greece must utilize this crisis to bring about real reform.
"As I have said, the Greek people deserve much better."
"We will have a lot to do, and once again, things will turn bitter, Mr. Langen."
We need to explain the necessity of integration to our citizens.
We have made it as heavy a wear as when discussing the constitution.
The necessity to integrate economic policy is what needs to be discussed henceforth.
"Otherwise, as Mr. MÃ¼nchau writes today, before long, Chancellor Merkel will return defeated from Brussels."
The Bild Zeitung will write that the Euro must be abolished and we must bring back the Deutsche Mark.
What will we do then?
It is not yet too late.
Germany is in a decisive position.
I hope that Mr. Sarkozy will not give in and be instead more sensible than Chancellor Merkel.
"I would like, in this chamber, to express approval for the Greek government."
"It is the government which, today, is facing protests on its streets."
The debate on EU 2020 economic strategy is naturally already on the agenda.
We want a strategy for Europe that gives social and ecological needs priority over competitive interests.
EU 2020 is miles away from this.
I hope that this attitude will not prevail among the majority of heads of government.
"Mr. President, my country, Greece, has many things in common with California."
The speaker is interrupted by a heckler.
"It is the economy, yes, it is."
"I realize that."
That is why I say what I say before.
Or would the central administration in the USA resolve its problem?
Do we or do we not have a central administration in the European Union?
Has it seen through the cohesion of the Euro and is it threatening the unity of the Union?
We have achieved a single European market.
We have achieved the Euro.
I do not think that we have achieved anything else in common.
That is why you also see me as a Eurosceptic.
"I trust that tomorrow, we shall prove that we really have achieved harmony and something in common."
Huh, those who spoke before me all mentioned solutions to the Greek crisis.
"Meanwhile, Mr. Barroso, the summit does not even place it on its agenda."
"Do you not see this as a contradiction, as hypocrisy?"
Because it does not appear on the official agenda.
"Of course, it is not just Greece that found itself in a difficult situation in 2008. An IMF loan was accepted there, a move that had extremely serious consequences for the population."
We need to face the question of what lessons the financial crisis has taught us.
Is it that everything is connected to everything else?
No.
Wall Street fell.
Leading to the Union seeking a solution for Greece.
Everyone has said so, and I am not going to repeat it.
Tougher sanctions would also have to be implemented so that the agreement truly appears binding.
What else does it involve?
Tell us what it involves, and we will help you.
