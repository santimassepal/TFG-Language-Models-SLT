"by agreement with the political groups , I would like to propose the following changes "
the president cut off the speaker 
"mr borghezio , this is not a point of order , since we are talking about a plenary sitting ."
this is almost without precedent .
i was simply making legitimate and indeed valid political comments with which the alde chair disagreed .
this is why the microphone was switched off .
"if the european parliament censors political comment , it ceases to be a parliament ."
i will reply in writing to the letter you sent me .
thursday
so this is about postponement of the vote .
we had originally agreed to put it on the agenda on the assumption that everything was in order .
we therefore ask for the vote on this issue to be postponed .
welcome
i have some special information for you .
they are with us at our sitting .
please welcome them .
applause 
the second vice president of the pan african parliament and chair of the delegation for relations with the european parliament .
"our parliaments work closely together , and your presence with us today gives us great pleasure ."
i am sure we will have the opportunity to meet again .
"once again , I warmly welcome you all ."
preparation for the european council meeting 25 26 march 2010 debate 
"however , europe is meeting this situation by creating new economic policy tools in all areas ."
"it is being done in this way , by coordinating economic policies ."
"there is , moreover , a quantified commitment to the so calledfast start."
the heads of state or government will largely be dealing with those matters .
we have challenging tasks ahead of us .
"for those tasks , the fresh and forceful backing of the european parliament is of great importance ."
that support was clearly expressed at different formations of the council of ministers .
but now to the european council I believe every european council must do two things .
"the crisis entails several pressing concerns for communities , workers and businesses across europe ."
"and , as we know , public finances at national level are under unprecedented strain ."
"the european union must of course tackle these issues , including financial stability ."
i will come back to this again later .
europe must not make the mistake of neglecting the imperative of working now to bring about long term change .
we have already debated the europe 2020 strategy together in this parliament .
"so , too , will be the contribution of the european council ."
our level of ambition must be set by the scale of the tasks ahead .
we need to show that we have the vision and the coherence to act .
this is why I believe it is so important that the european council agrees clear targets this week .
the targets which the commission has put on the table were carefully chosen .
this is also about the political will to tackle tough problems .
"of course , the targets must be achievable ."
so we cannot accept the principles of interdependence globally and reject them when discussed at european level .
what we are proposing here is a new departure .
accepting this approach will be the real test for the european council .
i am encouraged by the results of the informal european council .
we need to keep this top of our agenda .
so let us move on from soul searching about copenhagen and take the initiative once again .
"we need a clear , unified and ambitious position ."
that is why the commission has put forward a communication setting out the steps needed to reinvigorate international negotiations .
"at the same time , commissioner hedegaard has started a set of consultations with our key partners ."
these two areas show vividly how europeans are looking to the european union's political leadership for action .
let me therefore state our position on this .
greece is currently in the process of correcting its excessive government deficit .
bringing the deficit down vigorously is crucial and greece has been taking measures to that effect .
it should be clear that the creation of such a mechanism will not imply its automatic activation .
creating such a mechanism is also a question of responsibility and solidarity .
solidarity is a two way street .
the world economy needs stability .
i hope this issue will be solved in a spirit of responsibility and solidarity .
that is the european way to do it .
applause 
"to what extent are they willing to cooperate , and what are the lines they are unwilling to cross ?"
it is in everyone's interests that we guarantee the stability of europe and of the european monetary system .
this responsibility is that of each member state to guarantee accurate and reliable public accounts .
"in other words , yes , europe must show solidarity with greece ."
it must ensure that greece comes through this difficult period .
it now remains for greece to implement them .
"mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the crisis is forcing us to change ."
"the criteria of the stability and growth pact must be applied , and the commission must ensure this ."
this house will support it in this difficult task .
the second change concerns the governance of our public finances .
can this continue ?
i do not think so .
"such coordination will only make implementing solidarity based principles easier , fairer and more natural ."
"mr president in office of the council , I invite you to take initiatives along these lines ."
applause 
"greece has delivered , writes the international herald tribune ."
that is the first point .
applause 
the president of the commission has quite rightly spoken of a safety net .
that is not the objective .
interest rates are usually 2.5 to 3 % .
applause 
this means the people there are being robbed .
"the speculators will then turn their attention to italy , to the uk and to spain ."
"if we do not want to see a large scale conflagration , we need now to demonstrate solidarity with greece ."
it is not a matter of giving aid for the sake of it .
applause 
it is the commission that must propose how we can achieve a sensible stabilisation within the euro area .
the commission has made good proposals and I believe that the council should go along with them .
these do not include calling on the international monetary fund .
why not ?
we are in a position to resolve the problem within the euro area ourselves .
"moreover , I am astonished that chancellor merkel is bringing the international monetary fund into play ."
that is a quote from the german bundesbank .
that is not the right way to go .
the speculation will not cease until such a signal has been given .
this is nothing more than a game I will insure myself against my neighbour's house burning down .
"should my neighbour's house burn down , I get the insurance money ."
that is why solidarity with greece is an act to stabilise the euro in the euro area .
applause 
"i shall go further , mr president ."
that is my feeling today .
applause 
it is not about that .
there are two elements that count in terms of knowing what the interest rate is liquidity and credibility .
the only way of resolving that is really to take the necessary step of introducing this european instrument .
that is what will happen if a firm decision is not taken during this council .
applause 
that is why europe must intervene .
europe must intervene to ensure that greece's consolidation measures are worthwhile .
"they are necessary , but they must also be worthwhile ."
that is what we must hope for .
yet it is only now that we are debating the terms on which this assistance is being granted .
i think it is disgraceful .
applause 
the state of greece must utilise the crisis to bring about real reforms .
"as I have said , the greek people deserve much better ."
"we will then have a lot to do , and once again things will turn bitter , mr langen ."
we need to explain the necessity of integration to our citizens .
we have made as heavy weather of this as when discussing the constitution .
the necessity of integrating economic policy is what needs to be discussed henceforth .
"otherwise , as mr münchau wrote today , before long , chancellor merkel will be returning defeated from brussels ."
then bild zeitung will write the euro must be abolished we must bring back the deutsche mark .
what will we do then ?
it is not yet too late .
germany is in a decisive position .
i hope that mr sarkozy will not give in and is instead more sensible than chancellor merkel .
"i would like , in this chamber , to express approval for the greek government ."
"it is a government which , today , is facing protests on its streets ."
the debate on the eu 2020 economic strategy is naturally already on the agenda .
we want a strategy for europe that gives social and ecological needs priority over competitive interests .
eu 2020 is miles away from this .
i hope that this attitude will not prevail among the majority of the heads of government .
"mr president , my country , greece , has many things in common with california ."
the speaker was interrupted by a heckler 
"it is the economy yes , it is ."
i realise that .
that is why I said what I said before .
el . or would the central administration of the usa resolve its problem ?
do we or do we not have a central administration in the european union ?
has it sawed through the cohesion of the euro and is it threatening the unity of the union ?
we have achieved the single european market .
we have achieved the euro .
i do not think that we have achieved anything else in common .
that is why you also see me with the euro sceptics .
"i trust that tomorrow , we shall prove that we really have achieved harmony and something in common ."
hu those who spoke before me all mentioned the solution to the greek crisis .
"meanwhile , mr barroso , the summit did not even place it on its agenda ."
"do you not see this as a contradiction , as hypocrisy ?"
because it does not appear on the official agenda .
"of course , it is not just greece that found itself in a difficult situation in 2008 200an imf loan was accepted there , a move that has extremely serious consequences for the population ."
we need to face the question of what the lessons of the financial crisis are .
is it that everything is connected to everything else ?
no .
thewallstreet fell .
leading the union means seeking a solution for greece .
everyone has said so and I am not going to repeat it .
tougher sanctions would also have to be implemented so that the agreement really appears binding .
what else does it involve ?
tell us what it involves and we will help you .
