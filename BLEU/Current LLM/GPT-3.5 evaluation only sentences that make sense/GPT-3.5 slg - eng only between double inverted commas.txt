By agreement with the Desc-Political Group, I would like to propose the following change:
Mr. Borghzio, this is not the point of order, since we are talking about the Desc-Plenary Sit.
If the European Parliament censors Desc-Political comment, it ceases to be a Parliament.
We, as the Parliament, work closely together, and your presence with us today gives us great pleasure.
Once again, I warmly welcome all of you.
However, Europe is meeting this situation by creating a new economic policy tool in all areas.
It is being done in this way, by coordinating economic policy.
There are, moreover, quantified commitments to the so-called fast start.
For those tasks, fresh and forceful backing from the European Parliament is of great importance.
The crisis entails several pressing concerns for the community, workers, and businesses across Europe.
And, as we know, public finances at the national level are under unprecedented strain.
The European Union must course tackle these issues, including financial stability.
So, too, will be the contribution of the European Council.
Of course, the targets must be achievable.
We need a clear, unified, and ambitious position.
At the same time, Commissioner Hedegaard has started consultations with our key partners.
To what extent are you willing to cooperate, and what is the line you are unwilling to cross?
In other words, yes, Europe must show solidarity with Greece.
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis is forcing us to change.
The stability and growth pact criteria must be applied, and the Commission must ensure this.
Such coordination will not only make implementing solidarity-based principles easier, fairer, and more natural.
Mr. President in the Office of the Council, I invite you to take the initiative along these lines.
"Greece has delivered," wrote the International Herald Tribune.
Speculators will now turn their attention to Italy, the UK, and Spain.
If we do not want to see a large-scale conflagration, we need to demonstrate solidarity with Greece now.
Moreover, I am astonished that Chancellor Merkel is bringing the International Monetary Fund into play.
If my neighbor's house burns down, I get insurance money.
I shall go further, Mr. President.
It is necessary, but it must also be worthwhile.
As I have said, the Greek people deserve much better.
We will have a lot to do, and once again, things will turn bitter, Mr. Langen.
Otherwise, as Mr. MÃ¼nchau wrote today, before long, Chancellor Merkel will be returning defeated from Brussels.
I would like, in this chamber, to express approval for the Greek government.
It is the government which, today, is facing protests on its streets.
Mr. President, my country, Greece, has many things in common with California.
It is an economy, yes, it is.
I trust that tomorrow, we shall prove that we really have achieved harmony and something in common.
Meanwhile, Mr. Barroso, the summit doesn't even place it on its agenda.
Don't you see this as a contradiction, as hypocrisy?
Course, it is not just Greece that finds itself in a difficult situation. In 2008, a loan from the IMF was accepted, a move that had extremely serious consequences for the population.
Incidentally, this week, we are also proposing a new European mechanism for financial stability.
If implemented as it stands, Europe 2020 will be another Lisbon Strategy failure.
Firstly, the open coordination method is not working and must be abandoned.
As European politicians, we should always strive to put the citizen at the center of our policy.
I thank you, Madam President.
In other words, this means that until 2020, the equalization of economic disparity will be less dynamic.
Madam President, I think we have dealt sufficiently and fairly with the issue of Greece.
I should like to tell you that in Cyprus, the interest rate currently stands at 6%.
I have one thing to say about the one-minute speech, Madam President.
In the final analysis, it is humiliating to have to resort to slogans.
Only between 1-2% is used in the SME sector in some regions, according to a body representing SMEs.
This is a real problem, affecting the real economy, which Europe should address very seriously and urgently.
Madam President, I would like to start with some praise for Greece.
Chancellor Merkel takes flight and says, "Well, what does the treaty say?"
That applies not just to Germany, but to the European Union as a whole.
The answer, or lack of answer, that we have given so far is not acceptable.
However, we also need cooperation at the European level, in particular, to prevent such problems from arising.
Madam President, the spring summit was supposed to be an energy summit.
We are certainly able to help safeguard the common market from protectionism.
Better legislation is, of course, a particular responsibility of this very House, this Parliament.
By bringing in harmonization in this area, we are not only maintaining the ill European social model.
It is freedom, and not a successive strategy, which is the correct response to the crisis.
Nevertheless, we have a problem.
We must put an end to this now, and hopefully, we shall do so tomorrow.
Madam President, I hope that tomorrow we shall look beyond the debate on this crisis.
After all, as Mr. Ek also said, a free-for-all is not the way to success.
Yes, there is the treaty, letter, and spirit.
That issue is now on the table. It is serious and unresolved.
Madam President, two things.
First, concerns about public finances, and second, competitiveness.
Last year at this time, we were discussing in this Parliament how to face the crisis.
Or as Mr. McCreevy said, whenever politics interfere, the result is always worse.
No, she does not understand it at all.
That is why I am in favor of this major, strong currency.
The Europe 2020 strategy rightly states that growth should be intelligent, sustainable, and inclusive.
Of course, we have been talking about this for a long time.
This will actually help us to save costs, reduce dependency, and solve a series of problems.
Above all, we must make the target of 20% energy savings binding.
Indeed, how can you think we wage this battle against Chancellor Merkel?
Today, the debate revolves around Greece. Tomorrow, it will probably concern another member state.
However, it cannot face the fury of the market alone at this difficult stage.
Eighteen months ago, the market was threatening to bring down the global economy.
This includes reform efforts on the labor market, but it also includes national budgetary policy.
What's more, it will only succeed if the Commission takes the lead politically.
In other words, we absolutely must avoid the mistakes of the Lisbon Strategy.
From an economic point of view, it must be reflected in a commitment to governance.
Now, however, it has fully assumed its responsibility.
However, we must not hide our heads in the sand.
It is not, nor will it remain, the only target of speculators.
EMU will remain mutilated without more coordinated economic and fiscal policy and, above all, without solidarity.
Any crisis brings about change.
Madam President, I would like to make the point that you could not make this up today.
It is a self-centered opinion for those other member states, looking after themselves.
Madam President, the trouble in Greece and the Eurozone should not be seen as an exception.
A single currency for such a large, economically heterogeneous region is self-evidently problematic.
When the economy thrives, the value of a state's currency will tend to rise.
When the economy falls into recession, the value of the currency will tend to fall.
If it had experienced that depreciation, it would have benefited from a tourist boom.
Once inside, you will be locked in forever.
From a French perspective, Madam President, I have one observation and three proposals.
My second proposal concerns finance since we do not have instruments.
Lastly, it has to be said that Greece's accounting is flawed.
We need higher employment, better gender balance, and stronger education.
Firstly, Europe is about integrating economic policy. We have to integrate the economy.
Secondly, Europe is based on solidarity and therefore has a strong social content.
Thirdly, Europe has economic and financial stability.
Moreover, we are going to look further ahead.
Clearly, very important progress has therefore been made.
The debate is also on governance, as a fundamental element in that regard.
I do not think that should be criticized, on the contrary.
Therefore, the Minister's speech brings the debate to a close.
As a project, Europe has been about peace, social well-being, freedom, and growth.
The economic, financial, and social crises that we are currently experiencing require a concerted response at the European level.
The economic and financial crisis, and Greece, require European action.
Conclusions must be drawn at the local, European, and global levels.
By 2020, a single and secure European e-service area should be created.
It would provide EU citizens with easy and safe access to all digital services, both public and commercial.
For that reason, particular attention must be given to drawing up the 2020 strategy.
Member states must produce a clear concept, vision, and idea.
In my view, however, nuclear power is little suited to lead Europe into a sustainable energy future.
That is why, Mr. President, we have considered citizen initiatives to be a priority.
Until now, the European construct has been based on representative democracy.
Participation by citizens, therefore, is an issue dealt with at the European level.
Those who prepared this proposal have not told us what it involves.
I would ask that it contains at least three ideas.
Firstly, that it should be clear and simple.
In other words, do not let us make things complicated.
It strengthens the notion of citizenship, which is at the very root of the European project.
Be flexible, please!
Make access to this initiative easy, but let us make it clear as well and not disappoint expectations.
