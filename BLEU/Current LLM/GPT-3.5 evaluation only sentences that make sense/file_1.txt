by agreement with the political groups , I would like to propose the following changes
mr borghezio , this is not a point of order , since we are talking about a plenary sitting .
if the european parliament censors political comment , it ceases to be a parliament .
our parliaments work closely together , and your presence with us today gives us great pleasure .
once again , I warmly welcome you all .
however , europe is meeting this situation by creating new economic policy tools in all areas .
it is being done in this way , by coordinating economic policies .
there is , moreover , a quantified commitment to the so calledfast start.
for those tasks , the fresh and forceful backing of the european parliament is of great importance .
the crisis entails several pressing concerns for communities , workers and businesses across europe .
and , as we know , public finances at national level are under unprecedented strain .
the european union must of course tackle these issues , including financial stability .
so , too , will be the contribution of the european council .
of course , the targets must be achievable .
we need a clear , unified and ambitious position .
at the same time , commissioner hedegaard has started a set of consultations with our key partners .
to what extent are they willing to cooperate , and what are the lines they are unwilling to cross ?
in other words , yes , europe must show solidarity with greece .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the crisis is forcing us to change .
the criteria of the stability and growth pact must be applied , and the commission must ensure this .
such coordination will only make implementing solidarity based principles easier , fairer and more natural .
mr president in office of the council , I invite you to take initiatives along these lines .
greece has delivered , writes the international herald tribune .
the speculators will then turn their attention to italy , to the uk and to spain .
if we do not want to see a large scale conflagration , we need now to demonstrate solidarity with greece .
moreover , I am astonished that chancellor merkel is bringing the international monetary fund into play .
should my neighbour's house burn down , I get the insurance money .
i shall go further , mr president .
they are necessary , but they must also be worthwhile .
as I have said , the greek people deserve much better .
we will then have a lot to do , and once again things will turn bitter , mr langen .
otherwise , as mr m√ºnchau wrote today , before long , chancellor merkel will be returning defeated from brussels .
i would like , in this chamber , to express approval for the greek government .
it is a government which , today , is facing protests on its streets .
mr president , my country , greece , has many things in common with california .
it is the economy yes , it is .
i trust that tomorrow , we shall prove that we really have achieved harmony and something in common .
meanwhile , mr barroso , the summit did not even place it on its agenda .
do you not see this as a contradiction , as hypocrisy ?
of course , it is not just greece that found itself in a difficult situation in 2008 200an imf loan was accepted there , a move that has extremely serious consequences for the population .
incidentally , this week , we are also proposing a new european mechanism for financial stability .
if implemented as it stands , europe 2020 will be another lisbon strategy a failure .
firstly , the open coordination method is not working and must be abandoned .
as european politicians , we should always strive to put the citizens at the centre of our policy .
lv thank you , madam president .
in other words , this means that until 2020 , the equalisation of economic disparities will be less dynamic .
el madam president , I think we have dealt sufficiently and fairly with the issue of greece .
i should like to tell you that in cyprus , the interest rate currently stands at 6 % .
i have one thing to say about one minute speeches , madam president .
in the final analysis , it is humiliating to have to resort to slogans .
only between 1 2 % is used in the sme sector in some regions , according to bodies representing smes .
these are real problems , affecting the real economy , which europe should address very seriously and urgently .
de madam president , I would like to start with some praise for greece .
chancellor merkel takes flight and says well , what does the treaty say ?
that applies not just to germany , but to the european union as a whole .
the answer , or lack of an answer , that we have given so far is not acceptable .
however , we also need cooperation at european level , in particular , to prevent such problems arising .
madam president , the spring summit is supposed to be the energy summit .
we are , certainly , able to help safeguard the common market from protectionism .
better legislation is , of course , a particular responsibility of this very house , of this parliament .
by bringing in harmonisation in these areas , we are only maintaining the ills of the european social model .
it is freedom , and not successive strategies , which is the correct response to the crisis .
nevertheless , we have a problem .
we must put an end to this now , and hopefully we shall do so tomorrow .
madam president , I hope that tomorrow , we shall look beyond the debate on this crisis .
after all , as mrs ek also said , a free for all is not the way to success .
yes , there is the treaty , the letter and the spirit .
that issue is now on the table it is serious , it is unresolved .
madam president , two things .
the first concerns public finances , and the second competitiveness .
last year at this time , we were discussing in this parliament how to face the crisis .
or as mr mccreevy said whenever politics interferes , the result is always worse .
no , she did not understand it at all .
that is why I am in favour of this major , strong currency .
the europe 2020 strategy rightly states that growth should be intelligent , sustainable and inclusive .
of course , we have been talking about this for a long time .
this will actually help us to save costs , reduce dependencies and solve a series of problems .
above all , we must make the target of 20 % energy savings binding .
indeed , how can they think of waging this battle against chancellor merkel ?
today , the debate revolves around greece tomorrow it will probably concern another member state .
however , it cannot face the fury of the market alone at this difficult stage .
eighteen months ago , the markets were threatening to bring down the global economy .
this includes reform efforts on the labour market , but it also includes national budgetary policy .
what is more , it will only succeed if the commission takes the lead politically .
in other words , we absolutely must avoid the mistakes of the lisbon strategy .
from the economic point of view , it must be reflected in the commitment to governance .
now , however , it has fully assumed its responsibilities .
however , we must not hide our heads in the sand .
it is not , nor will it remain , the only target of speculators .
emu will remain mutilated without more coordinated economic and fiscal policy and , above all , without solidarity .
the crisis , any crisis is the mother of change .
madam president , I would like to make the point that you could not make this up today .
it is a self centred opinion for those other member states , looking after themselves .
madam president , the troubles of greece and the eurozone should not be seen as an exception .
a single currency for such a large , economically heterogeneous region of the world is self evidently problematic .
when the economy thrives , the value of the state's currency will tend to rise .
when an economy falls into recession , the value of the currency will tend to fall .
if it had experienced that depreciation , it would have benefited from a tourist boom .
once inside , you will be locked in for ever .
fr madam president , I have one observation and three proposals .
my second proposal concerns finance , since we do not have the instruments .
lastly , it has been said that greece's accounting was flawed .
we need higher employment , we need a better gender balance and we need stronger education .
firstly , europe is an integration of economic policies we have integrated economies .
secondly , europe is based on solidarity and therefore has a strong social content .
thirdly , europe has economic and financial stability .
moreover , we are going to look further ahead .
clearly , very important progress is therefore being made .
the debate was also on governance , as a fundamental element in that regard .
i do not think that should be criticised , quite the contrary .
therefore , the minister's speech brings the debate to a close .
as a project , europe has been about peace , social well being , freedom and growth .
the economic , financial and social crisis that we are currently experiencing requires a concerted response at european level .
the economic and financial crisis , and greece , require european action .
the conclusions must be drawn at the local , the european and the global level .
by 2020 , a single and secure european e services area should be created .
it would provide eu citizens with easy and safe access to all digital services , both public and commercial .
for that reason , particular attention must be given to the drawing up of the 2020 strategy .
the member states must produce clear concepts , visions and ideas .
in my view , however , nuclear power is little suited to leading europe into a sustainable energy future .
that is why , mr president , we have considered the citizensinitiative to be a priority .
until now , the european construct was based on representative democracy .
participation by citizens , therefore , and issues dealt with at european level .
mr ≈°efƒçoviƒç , who is preparing this proposal , has not told us what it involves .
on behalf of my group , mr ≈°efƒçoviƒç , I would ask that it contain at least three ideas .
firstly , that it should be clear and simple .
in other words , do not let us make things complicated .
it strengthens the notion of citizenship , which is at the very root of the european project .
be flexible , please !
make access to this initiative easy , but let us make it clear as well and not disappoint expectations .
