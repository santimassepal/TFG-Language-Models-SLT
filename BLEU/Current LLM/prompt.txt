Hi, I'm going to provide you with English Sign Language Glosses. Each line break indicates the end of the previous sentence and the start of the new one I want you to translate each one of them to spoken English INDIVIDUALLY! Don't add the original glosses nor tags or anything, just the translations, cause it's for a csv file of a single column which must contain the translation ONLY. 

My input will follow this structure: 

slg gloss1
slg gloss2

your output should be as follows:

translation1
translation2

That's the only thing I want, you won't receive further instructions:
