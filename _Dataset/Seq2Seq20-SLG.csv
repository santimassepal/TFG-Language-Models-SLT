"EURO , DESC-STABLE DESC-COMMON CURRENCY , HAVE PLAY PART DESC-REAL DESC-MONETARY SHIELD ."
"EURO AREA HAVE DESC-REFORE BECOME MORE DESC-ATTRACTIVE , AS CASE ICELAND SHOW ."

"MR PRESIDENT , LADY AND GENTLEMAN , MR GIEGOLD X-POSS REPORT BE DESC-PARTICULARLY DESC-SIGNIFICANT GIVE DESC-CURRENT MACRO DESC-ECONOMIC DEBATE ."
THIS CRISIS BE DESC-FAR FROM BEHIND X-WE .
X-Y WILL EXACERBATE UNEMPLOYMENT AND WILL FUEL DESC-SOCIAL TENSION .
GIEGOLD REPORT HAVE MERIT DRAW ATTENTION TO SOME SE MACRO DESC-ECONOMIC IMBALANCE .
"X-WE HOLD DESC-LONG DISCUSSION WITH X-Y AND IN END , AGREE ON DESC-MANY COMPROMISE AMENDMENT ."
X-I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO X-YOU TODAY ABOUT EURO .
SE TWO YEAR DESC-TERRIBLE DESC-GLOBAL DESC-ECONOMIC CRISIS HAVE SHOW THAT EURO HAVE DESC-FIRMLY ANCHOR X-WE TO STABILITY .
"X-IT BE , IN FACT , DESC-ONLY DESC-MAJOR DESC-WESTERN CURRENCY THAT HAVE DESC-NOT MAKE X-ITS USER DESC-POORER ."
EURO POSE NO RISK TO MEDITERRANEAN ECONOMY .
X-WE IN EURO AREA MUST DESC-NOT PENALIZE COUNTRY THAT EXPORT MOST .
"DESC-NEVERLESS , UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE MUST X-ITS EXPORT STRENGTH BE WEAKEN ."
THOSE WHO DO DESC-BEST CAN DESC-NOT BE PENALIZE .
"X-I WOULD LIKE , START FROM WHERE X-WE BE TODAY , TO TAKE LOOK DESC-FORWARD ."
WHERE BE X-WE ?
"DESC-SECOND , X-WE CAN DESC-NOT IGNORE FACT THAT X-WE DESC-ALREADY HAVE DESC-HUGE AND DEEPEN DESC-SOCIAL INEQUALITY ."
DESC-SO WHAT X-WE BELIEVE BE THAT X-WE SHOULD DESC-REALLY SWITCH GEAR .
COURSE .
WHAT DO THAT MEAN ?
GREECE HAVE 4 % X-ITS GDP GO TO DESC-MILITARY SPENDING .
X-Y HAVE GET AIR FORCE THAT BE AS DESC-BIG AS LUFTWAFFE .
"X-I MEAN , HOW COME ?"
X-IT BE DESC-SUCH DESC-TINY COUNTRY AND X-Y BE ARM X-MSELVES LIKE HELL .
"BUT IF X-WE DESC-JUST LOOK AT EXPENDITURE SIDE , X-WE WILL DESC-NOT SUCCEED ."
"X-WE NEED TO REBALANCE TAX INCOME DESC-AWAY FROM LABOR INCOME TOWARDS DESC-OR FORM INCOME , INCLUDE CAPITAL INCOME ."
AND X-WE CAN DESC-NOT DO THAT DESC-JUST BY ASK COUNTRY TO COORDINATE X-Y POLICY .
X-WE NEED MORE INTEGRATION .
DESC-SO X-I BELIEVE THAT EUROPE BE DESC-NOW AT DESC-CRITICAL JUNCTURE .
"CHOICE BE BETWEEN DESC-HIGHER DEGREE INTEGRATION , DESC-NOT DESC-JUST COORDINATION , AND DECLINE ."
LESSON THAT X-I TAKE FROM COPENHAGEN BE DESC-NOT DESC-JUST THAT X-WE MISS CLIMATE AGREEMENT .
X-IT BE THAT EUROPE HAVE PROVE TO BE DESC-IRRELEVANT IF X-IT BE DESC-NOT ACT DESC-TOGER .
"X-WE SPEND DESC-TOO DESC-MUCH TIME COORDINATE , DESC-TOO DESC-LITTLE TIME ACT DESC-TOGER ."
DESC-SO THAT WOULD BE X-WE CONTRIBUTION TO THIS DEBATE .

"DESC-HOWEVER , EURO DO DESC-NOT SIT IN ISOLATION ."
"WHILE X-Y MAY BE UNITE BY DESC-COMMON CURRENCY , ATTITUDE TOWARDS SAVE AND SPENDING VARY DESC-CONSIDERABLY ."
JOIN DESC-MONETARY UNION DO DESC-NOT UNITE DESC-COMPLETELY DESC-DIFFERENT CULTURE AND TRADITION DESC-FISCAL POLICY .
UK PERSPECTIVE HAVE LOT TO SAY ON DIFFERENCE IN DESC-FISCAL POLICY .
"DESC-FUNDAMENTALLY , MONEY TO FUND PUBLIC SECTOR DO DESC-NOT DESC-MAGICALLY APPEAR ."
X-IT COME FROM TAX RECEIPT FROM DESC-PRIVATE SECTOR .
GERMANY REALIZE THIS .
"DESC-HENCE , X-IT BE DESC-NOW IN DESC-STRONG POSITION FOR RECOVERY ."
"DESC-ULTIMATELY , PUBLIC SECTOR HAVE DO X-ITS JOB IN CRISIS ."
X-IT BAIL OUT BANK AND STEP DESC-UP WHEN DESC-PRIVATE SECTOR FAIL .
DESC-NOW X-IT BE TURN DESC-PRIVATE SECTOR TO REPLENISH COFFER .
"ON ONE HAND , X-WE BE TALK ABOUT COMMUNITY WITH DESC-COMMON DESTINY ."
THAT BE DESC-PREPOSTEROUS !
"MOST DESC-IMPORTANTLY , THIS WOULD BE ADMISSION FAILURE WHICH WOULD AMOUNT TO KOWTOW TO DESC-FINANCIAL SECTOR ."
TAKE THIS ROUTE WOULD BE EQUIVALENT DRIVE EU PROJECT INTO WALL .
EURO CAN DESC-NOT PROVIDE ANSWER TO DESC-DIFFERENT LEVEL PRODUCTIVITY IN INDIVIDUAL ECONOMY .
DESC-MAJOR EXPORTER DESC-SUCH AS GERMANY BE FORCE GREEK DESC-ECONOMIC POLICY TO X-ITS KNEE .
"DESC-REFORE , THIS DESC-ALSO REPRESENT CRISIS IN EU DESC-ECONOMIC AND COMPETITION POLICY ."
THIS BE WHY X-WE BE CALL FOR BAN ON DESC-FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR EU MEMBER STATE TO BE LIFT .
THIS BE WHAT X-WE BE CALL FOR .
PRESIDENT CUT OFF SPEAKER

"AIRLINE BE DESC-VITAL PART X-WE TRANSPORT SYSTEM , DESC-NOT DESC-ONLY FOR PASSENGER , BUT DESC-ALSO FOR GOODS ."
X-IT BE DESC-IMPORTANT THAT X-WE DESC-NOW ACKNOWLEDGE THIS FACT DESC-ONCE DESC-AGAIN .
X-WE HAVE DESC-NOT DESC-YET SUCCEED IN BRING ABOUT INTEROPERABILITY TRAIN BETWEEN DESC-DIFFERENT COUNTRY .

DESC-VOLCANIC ERUPTION IN ICELAND SHOULD BE WARN TO ALL X-WE .
WHAT X-WE BE DESC-NOW EXPERIENCE BE REALITY FUTURE TRANSPORT .
X-I THINK X-IT BE DESC-ONLY DESC-RIGHT THAT X-WE HAVE TODAY AT DESC-LEAST MANAGE TO DESC-PARTIALLY RESUME FLIGHT .
X-I DESC-REFORE APPROVE APPROACH THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT DIFFERENCE IN CONCENTRATION DESC-VOLCANIC DUST .
"THIS REOPEN BE DESC-DESPERATELY NEED , X-I THINK , BECAUSE DESC-ICELANDIC ASH BE STARVE X-WE AIRLINE CASH ."
POSSIBILITY THAT DESC-FEW STRUGGLE AIRLINE MIGHT COLLAPSE IN THIS CRISIS DO DESC-NOT CAUSE X-I DESC-MUCH CONCERN .
"DESC-HOWEVER , X-WE CAN DESC-NOT ALLOW DESC-MAJOR AND DESC-REPUTABLE COMPANY WHICH PUT SAFETY DESC-FIRST TO COLLAPSE ."
DESC-TOO DESC-MUCH MONEY AND DESC-TOO DESC-MANY JOB BE AT STAKE .
"IN ADDITION , X-WE HAVE TO WORK WITH DESC-REALISTIC APPROACH THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT DUST PARTICLE CONCENTRATION ."
X-IT BE DESC-RIGHT THAT SOME PART AIRSPACE SHOULD BE REOPEN TODAY .
"IN X-MY OPINION , X-IT BE DESC-IRRESPONSIBLE FOR AIRLINE TO ASK X-Y PILOT TO FLY AT X-Y DESC-OWN RISK ."
WHAT DOESAT X-Y DESC-OWN DESC-RISKACTUALLY MEAN IN THIS CASE ?
X-WE WILL BE TALK DESC-LATER ABOUT EMPLOYMENT IN EUROPEAN UNION .
X-IT BE DESC-HIGH TIME THAT COMMISSION PUT IN PLACE DESC-PERMANENT DESC-COMMON EUROPEAN MONITORING SYSTEM FOR AVIATION SAFETY .
THIS MONITORING SYSTEM SHOULD BE DESC-SPECIFICALLY DESIGN TO PREVENT DESC-SOCIAL DUMP .
COMPETITION AND PURSUIT PROFIT MUST DESC-NOT BE ALLOW TO TAKE PRIORITY OVER SAFETY DESC-HUMAN LIFE .
"X-IT BE DESC-TRUE THAT SOME RESTRICTION HAVE DESC-PERHAPS BE DESC-EXCESSIVE , DESC-ESPECIALLY WHERE SAFETY BE CONCERN ."
"WHY , THOUGH , BAN FLIGHT IN BELGIUM WHEN CLOUD BE IN NORWAY ?"
"X-I DESC-REFORE CALL FOR SWIFT ACTION , DESC-SERIOUS ACTION , AND ACTION IN DESC-FULL KNOWLEDGE FACT ."
"DE MR PRESIDENT , LADY AND GENTLEMAN , SAFETY HAVE PRIORITY OVER ALL DESC-OR CONSIDERATION ."
BOTH PLANE DESC-NARROWLY ESCAPE DISASTER .
DESC-HUMAN LIFE BE DESC-PRICELESS .
SE FLIGHT BE DESC-NOT DESC-ABLE TO CARRY OUT ANY DESC-REAL ANALYSIS OR PRODUCE ANY DESC-SIGNIFICANT RESULT .
"NATURE TEACH X-WE RESPECT AND , AT DESC-SAME TIME , MAKE DESC-CLEAR TO X-WE LIMIT GLOBALISATION ."
X-WE BE ALL DESC-HIGHLY DESC-AWARE DESC-SERIOUS DESC-FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCE .
"DESC-HOWEVER , DESC-HUMAN LIFE BE WORTH DESC-MUCH MORE THAN GOODS ."
THIS COORDINATION HAVE WORK DESC-EXCEPTIONALLY DESC-WELL .

X-WE NEED TO GIVE X-WE ATTENTION TO THAT .
THAT BE ANOR MODEL .
LET X-WE SEE HOW X-WE CAN DESC-REALLY INTEGRATE SAFETY AND EFFICIENCY WITH THAT .
X-MY DESC-THIRD AND DESC-LAST POINT BE ABOUT HOW X-WE BE COPE WITH DESC-ECONOMIC IMPACT .
"X-IT BE DESC-GOOD IDEA TO LIST DESC-VARIOUS POSSIBILITY , BUT X-WE NEED EUROPEAN APPROACH ."
THAT BE DESC-SIMPLY DESC-NOT DESC-POSSIBLE .
WHY BE X-IT THAT COUNCIL DESC-ALWAYS THINK IN DESC-INTERGOVERNMENTAL AND DESC-NATIONAL TERM AND DESC-NOT IN EUROPEAN TERM ?
THAT BE ONE LESSON WHICH X-WE BE GO TO HAVE TO TAKE DESC-AWAY FROM THIS SITUATION .
"DESC-WELL , GIVE EUROPE THOSE POWER , AT DESC-LONG DESC-LAST !"
THAT WOULD MAKE THING LOT DESC-SIMPLER .
X-MY DESC-SECOND POINT CONCERN DESC-SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION .
"THAT BE , DESC-INDEED , DESC-RIGHT DECISION TO MAKE , BUT DO THAT GO DESC-FAR DESC-ENOUGH ?"
THIS VOLCANO HAVE DESC-NOT FINISH ERUPT DESC-YET .
"WHEN X-IT DESC-LAST ERUPT 200 YEAR DESC-AGO , X-IT REMAIN DESC-ACTIVE FOR TEN YEAR ."
"DESC-SO , X-WE NEED TO MAKE PREPARATION FOR YEAR TO COME ."
X-I FIND THAT DESC-EXTRAORDINARY .
DESC-RE BE NO POCKET BOOK PRECAUTION .
SAFETY AND DESC-COMMON DESC-GOOD BE PRIORITY .
"AS FOR REST , X-I BELIEVE THAT X-WE MUST , COURSE , DEVELOP RAIL TRANSPORT ."
X-I DESC-ALSO BELIEVE THAT DIVERSITY TRANSPORT AND MODE TRANSPORT BE DESC-IMPORTANT .
"X-I DESC-ALSO BELIEVE THAT , DESC-STRUCTURALLY SPEAK , X-WE MUST PROVIDE DESC-FAR DESC-GREATER SUPPORT FOR VIDEOCONFERENCING ."
X-I BELIEVE THAT SUPPORT FOR DESC-SUCH PRACTICE WOULD HELP X-WE TO REDUCE X-WE DEPENDENCE ON AIR TRAVEL .
DIVERSIFICATION SITUATION WHICH ARISE BE DESC-NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AT ALL .
X-WE SHOULD LIKE TO SAY DESC-HERE THAT PRINCIPLE PASSENGER SAFETY MUST BE REAFFIRM AS PRIORITY PRINCIPLE .
"X-I SHOULD LIKE , AT DESC-SAME TIME , TO SAY THAT EUROPE SUFFER FROM DESC-TOO DESC-LITTLE CREDIBILITY ."
"DA MR PRESIDENT , X-I HAVE TWO DESC-IMPORTANT POINT TO MAKE ."
"DESC-SECONDLY , X-I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL PARTY INVOLVE FOR X-Y EFFORT ."
X-IT REMAIN TO BE DECIDE WHER OR DESC-NOT AIRLINE WILL BE DESC-FINANCIALLY COMPENSATE .
OUTCOME WILL BE DECIDE BY DEBATE IN DAY DESC-AHEAD .
X-IT BE DESC-GOOD TO HEAR THAT DESC-RE BE DESC-NOW THREE STEP PLAN .
X-I BE DESC-PLEASED ABOUT THAT .
X-I HOPE THAT X-WE DESC-HERE IN PARLIAMENT WILL DESC-IMMEDIATELY REJECT THAT MODEL .
"DESC-HOWEVER , AIRCRAFT BE DESC-VULNERABLE DESC-NOT DESC-ONLY TO DESC-TERRORIST ATTACK , BUT DESC-ALSO TO EXTREME WEAR CONDITION ."
AIRCRAFT BE DESC-HIGHLY ENERGY DESC-INTENSIVE AND POLLUTE .
"MR PRESIDENT , TODAY X-WE KNOW DESC-BETTER THAN X-WE DO WEEK DESC-AGO THAT JET DESC-FREE SKY COST LOT ."
COST TO AIRLINE GO BEYOND X-Y LOSE REVENUE .
"DESC-OR INDUSTRY BE AFFECT , THOUGH DESC-RE BE DESC-ALSO INDUSTRY BENEFIT FROM SITUATION ."
X-I WOULD LIKE TO RAISE TWO ISSUE .
DESC-FIRST BE RELATE TO STATE AID .
"EUROPEAN COMMISSION DESC-ALSO OFFER DESC-FAST TRACK PROCEDURE TO STATE AID , WHICH BE APPRECIATE ."
BE STATE AID THROUGH DESC-NATIONAL BUDGET DESC-BEST SOLUTION ?
BE ANY DESC-OR OPTION BE CONSIDER BY EUROPEAN COMMISSION ?
DESC-SECOND ISSUE BE RELATE TO EUROPEAN UNION X-POSS CAPACITY TO MANAGE CRISIS .
"X-I CAN ASSURE X-YOU , COMMISSIONER , THAT X-YOU CAN BE DESC-TOTALLY DESC-INDEPENDENT AND DESC-STILL COORDINATE ."
"DESC-HOWEVER , SITUATION ON RAILWAY REMAIN DESC-APPALLING ."
THIS BE DESC-NOT DESC-ACCEPTABLE .
WHERE WOULD X-WE BE TODAY IF X-WE HAVE IMPLEMENT PROVISION DESC-SO CALL DELOR PLAN ?
X-WE WOULD DESC-ALREADY HAVE TRAN EUROPEAN NETWORK AND X-WE WOULD HAVE MORE DESC-HIGH SPEED RAIL LINE AND DESC-HIGH SPEED TRAIN .
X-WE NEED DESC-CERTAIN AMOUNT RESERVE .
X-WE MUST DESC-ALSO PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON ACCOMMODATION .
X-Y DESC-ALSO NEED TO HAVE DESC-IMMEDIATE EFFECT THAT EVERYONE CAN SEE .
X-WE DESC-REFORE DESC-ALSO NEED DESC-GREATER TRANSPARENCY DESC-NOW THAT THREE ZONE HAVE BE DEFINE .
X-WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT X-Y BE AND WHAT X-Y BE GO TO MEAN .
"DESC-SECONDLY , X-Y HAVE DESC-RIGHT TO BE GUARANTEE TOTAL RESPECT FOR PASSENGERSRIGHT ."
DESC-FINAL THING THAT X-Y HAVE DESC-RIGHT TO BE GUARANTEE BE STATE AID FOR AIRLINE .
WHAT THIS DESC-CURRENT CRISIS HAVE DESC-VERY DESC-CLEARLY SHOW BE NEED TO DEVELOP EUROPEAN COORDINATION AND INTEROPERABILITY DESC-FURR .
"MR PRESIDENT , AS HAVE DESC-ALREADY BE SAY , NO ONE COULD HAVE PREDICT DESC-RECENT EVENT IN ICELAND ."
"AT DESC-LEAST , THAT BE WAY PUBLIC PERCEIVE X-IT ."
THIS HAVE BE DISASTER FOR ALL CONCERN .
"DESC-LONG TERM PROGNOSIS , DESC-NOT DECISION BY KNEE JERK BULLETIN , BE WHAT BE REQUIRE ."
"DESC-MOREOVER , TRAVEL AGENCY BE DESC-EXEMPT FROM OBLIGATION TO COMPENSATE TRAVELLER FOR DESC-UNUSED FLIGHT ."
"THAT BE DESC-NOT DESC-RIGHT , EIR ."
ERUPTION VOLCANO IN ICELAND HAVE HIGHLIGHT TO X-WE WEAKNESS EUROPEAN TRANSPORT SYSTEM .
"IN SE CIRCUMSTANCE , DESC-RAPID PROVISION DESC-ACCURATE INFORMATION TO PASSENGER BE DESC-ABSOLUTE MUST ."
PASSENGER SAFETY MUST BE X-WE OVERRIDE CONCERN .
ANOR DESC-INCREASINGLY DESC-PARAMOUNT ASPECT BE DEVELOPMENT TRANSPORT ALONG DESC-INLAND WATERWAY AND EUROPEAN MARITIME CORRIDOR .
. X-WE DEMONSTRATE DESC-POLITICAL WILL AND STICK TO X-WE SLOGAN KEEP EUROPE MOVE !
X-I COME FROM COUNTRY IRELAND WHERE X-WE BE TWO SEA CROSS FROM MAINLAND EUROPE .
"AFTER ANNOUNCEMENT DESC-LAST NIGHT , DESC-RE BE DESC-REAL HOPE THAT SITUATION WOULD EASE ."
X-WE MUST DEAL WITH THIS FROM CENTER .
"X-I AGREE THAT DEAL WITH X-IT FROM 27 PERSPECTIVE , OR COUNTRY , BE DESC-NOT DESC-SUCCESSFUL ."
ONE DESC-BIGGEST PROBLEM FACE PASSENGER TODAY BE CONFUSION .
PRESIDENT CUT OFF SPEAKER
"DESC-INDEED , DESC-MANY X-WE DESC-OWN COLLEAGUE FROM DESC-FAR FLUNG CORNER EUROPE HAVE BE LEAVE STRAND THIS WEEK ."
X-IT HAVE DESC-ALSO REMIND X-WE HOW ADDICT X-WE HAVE BECOME TO AIR TRANSPORTATION .
X-WE KNOW X-WE MUST REDUCE THAT DEPENDENCY IN YEAR TO COME .
"X-WE SHOULD DESC-WELCOME INVESTMENT IN ADVANCE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM FOR DESC-VIRTUAL MEETING , AS DESC-WELL AS INVESTMENT IN DESC-HIGH SPEED RAILWAY ."
"DESC-FINALLY , PLAN TO REDUCE DESC-UNNECESSARY TRAVEL SHOULD BE DESC-WELCOME ."
THAT BE DESC-CLEARLY ONE AREA WHERE PARLIAMENT COULD LEAD BY EXAMPLE .
"DESC-INADEQUATE RESPONSE MAY BE JUSTIFY IN DESC-SUCH CASE , BUT DESC-ONLY DESC-ONCE ."
X-WE MUST DESC-CLOSELY ANALYZE WHAT HAPPEN AND PREPARE DESC-EFFECTIVE RESPONSE IN EVENT DESC-SUCH PHENOMENON RECUR .
INFORMATION ABOUT ERUPTION X-POSS CONSEQUENCE BE DESC-INADEQUATE .
"COMPANIESRESPONSE BE DESC-LATE AND DESC-DISJOINTED , WHICH CREATE DESC-MAJOR PROBLEM FOR PASSENGER ."
"THIS YEAR , DESC-EXACT DESC-SAME THING BE HAPPEN WITH EUROPEAN FREIGHT CORRIDOR ."
X-I BELIEVE THAT MEMBER STATE SHOULD UNDERSTAND SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT HAVE HAPPEN DESC-NOW .
MEMBER STATESRESPONSE BE DESC-INADEQUATE AND X-IT FAIL TO PROVIDE TRANSPORT VIA DESC-OR MEANS .
"DESC-CURRENTLY IN EUROPE , X-IT BE DESC-NOT DESC-POSSIBLE TO BUY TRAIN TICKET IN DESC-CIVILISED MANNER ."
"WHAT BE NEED BE COORDINATION , RESPONSIBILITY AND DECISION MAKE FACILITY , ALL AT EUROPEAN UNION LEVEL ."
"EL MR PRESIDENT , SKILL CAPTAIN SHOW IN STORM ."
"DESC-JUST AS X-WE BE DESC-SLOW TO REACT TO DESC-ECONOMIC STORM , BUT THAT BE ANOR STORY ."
DESC-RE BE TWO ASPECT TO TODAY X-POSS DEBATE
"DESC-FIRSTLY , AS REGARD BAN ON FLIGHT AND COORDINATION ."
THAT BE MATTER FOR DESC-COMPETENT DESC-NATIONAL AUTHORITY .
THAT TERRIFY X-I .
"NL MR PRESIDENT , COMMISSIONER , LADY AND GENTLEMAN , DESC-GOOD MORNING ."
"X-WE BE DEAL WITH DESC-EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCE DESC-HERE , COURSE ."
X-WE DESC-CLEARLY HAVE TO LEARN FROM THIS SITUATION AND TAKE DESC-APPROPRIATE MEASURE .
RAPPORTEUR BE MR FERREIRA .
DESC-PLENARY WILL DESC-VERY DESC-SOON BE DESC-ABLE TO FORMULATE PARLIAMENT X-POSS POSITION ON SE SUBJECT .
X-I AGREE WITH MEMBER WHO HAVE SAY THAT X-WE BE DESC-POORLY PREPARE FOR DESC-NATURAL DISASTER .
"DESC-FORTUNATELY , EUROPE HAVE DESC-FEW DESC-NATURAL DISASTER ."
"IN X-MY OPINION , X-IT ALL TAKE DESC-TOO DESC-LONG ."
FIVE DAY BEFORE TEST FLIGHT TAKE PLACE AND DESC-REAL DATUM BE COLLECT BE DESC-SIMPLY DESC-TOO DESC-LONG .
X-WE MUST LEARN FROM THIS .
"IF THIS DESC-VOLCANIC ASH HAVE MAKE ONE THING DESC-CLEAR , X-IT BE NEED FOR MORE EUROPE ."
"MR KALLUM , X-YOU HAVE SAY THAT DESC-NATIONAL AUTHORITY HAVE RESPONSIBILITY ."
"DESC-HOWEVER , THIS DO DESC-NOT HELP PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFER AS RESULT ."
X-WE NEED MORE EUROPE IN DESC-CIVIL PROTECTION AND IN DESC-COMMON TRANSPORT POLICY .
TREATY LISBON DESC-OPEN DESC-UP MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR X-WE .
THIS SITUATION MUST IMPROVE .
MUST SE TEST FLIGHT BE CARRY OUT BY DESC-CIVIL AVIATION AND AIRLINE ?
"DESC-SO DESC-FAR , DESC-HOWEVER , DESC-ONLY ISOLATE AND DESC-NATIONAL INITIATIVE HAVE BE TAKE ."
REPATRIATE X-Y MUST BE X-WE PRIORITY .
"ALTHOUGH THIS APPROACH BE DESC-PRECAUTIONARY , AS X-IT HAVE TO BE , X-IT RAISE DESC-IMPORTANT QUESTION ."
WORK DO AT EUROPEAN AND DESC-NATIONAL LEVEL BE DESC-NOT DESC-SUFFICIENT .
END UNCERTAINTY AS DESC-SOON AS DESC-POSSIBLE WILL DESC-ALSO HELP X-WE TO GET OUT THIS CRISIS .
"RAILWAY , ROAD AND MARITIME SECTOR PUT DESC-TOGER HAVE DESC-NOT MANAGE TO REPLACE X-IT ."
"PL MR PRESIDENT , MR KALLUM , X-WE BE DESC-CERTAINLY DEAL WITH CRISIS SITUATION ."
"X-I DO HOPE , DESC-HOWEVER , THAT X-WE BE DESC-ABLE TO DRAW DESC-SEVERAL DESC-CONSTRUCTIVE CONCLUSION ."
"DESC-THIRDLY , QUESTION PASSENGER ."
X-I THINK DECISION TO HALT FLIGHT OUT CONCERN FOR PASSENGER SAFETY BE DESC-WISE ONE .
X-Y HAVE ACT ACCORD TO PRINCIPLE THAT SAFETY BE DESC-PARAMOUNT .
X-WE CAN DISCUSS WHER ASH CLOUD SHOULD HAVE BE INVESTIGATE MORE DESC-QUICKLY .
"X-I BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD HAVE BE DESC-POSSIBLE , BUT IN PRINCIPLE , WHAT BE DO BE DESC-ACCEPTABLE ."
X-I BE CALL YESTERDAY BY THREE PEOPLE WHO BE IN THIS SITUATION .
X-Y HAVE DESC-ALREADY SPEND WHOLE WEEK AT AIRPORT .
SE BE ISSUE WHICH X-WE IN EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT NEED TO THINK ABOUT AND DISCUSS .
"X-WE MUST OFFER SE PEOPLE SOLUTION , GIVE X-Y SUPPORT AND MAKE DESC-USEFUL PROPOSAL ."
X-WE CAN DESC-NOT ABANDON EUROPEAN CITIZEN WHO BE IN THIS SITUATION X-WE MUST HELP X-Y .
"THANK X-YOU DESC-VERY DESC-MUCH , LADY AND GENTLEMAN ."
"SAFETY OBJECTIVE HAVE DESC-REFORE BE ACHIEVE , AND X-WE CAN DESC-ONLY BE PLEASE ABOUT THAT ."

"IF THIS CONTINUE TO BE CASE IN FUTURE , DESC-N SE SORT DEBATE BE DESC-POINTLESS ."

DESC-OR THING X-WE ASK COMMISSION BE DESC-NOT TO TOLERATE LIE AND DECEPTION .
"THIS BE CASE IN DESC-HUNGARY , THIS BE CASE IN GREECE ."
COMMISSION OUGHT TO EXERCISE X-ITS COMPETENCE IN THIS REGARD .
DO DESC-NOT MISUNDERSTAND X-I .
X-I BE DESC-NOT SAY THAT COMMISSION BE TO BLAME FOR SE CRISIS .
DESC-NOW LET X-WE MOVE ON TO WHAT COMMISSION SHOULD DO .

"JOB , JOB , JOB MUST BE X-WE GUIDE PRINCIPLE ."
X-WE CONSIDER X-IT DESC-IMPORTANT THAT DESC-SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE ENTERPRISE TAKE DESC-ACTIVE PART IN PROCESS JOB CREATION .
X-Y WOULD DESC-NOT LIKE X-IT IF 2020 JOB CREATION PROGRAM BE SHOVE DESC-DOWN PARLIAMENT X-POSS THROAT .

"X-Y BE IN STRASBOURG , BUT X-Y BE DESC-NOT IN CHAMBER WHERE X-Y SHOULD BE ."
X-I FIND THAT DESC-VERY DESC-SAD .
HOW CAN X-WE ENSURE THAT THIS HAPPEN IN ERA DESC-BUDGETARY CONSOLIDATION ?
X-IT GO WITHOUT SAY THAT X-WE MUST CONSOLIDATE X-WE BUDGET .
X-MY NEXT POINT RELATE TO DESC-BUDGETARY CONSOLIDATION .
X-WE NEED MORE INVESTMENT .
X-WE DISCUSS THIS DESC-EARLIER ON THIS MORNING WITH MR KALLUM .
"X-WE HAVE INVEST DESC-TOO DESC-LITTLE , FOR EXAMPLE , IN TRAN EUROPEAN NETWORK ."
X-WE CAN DESC-NOT TOLERATE THIS .
"MR BARROSO , X-YOU REFER TO MONTUS REPORT ."
"DESC-HOWEVER , WHEN X-WE TALK ABOUT DESC-SINGLE MARKET , X-WE MUST DESC-ALSO REFER TO DESC-SOCIAL MARKET ECONOMY ."
"IN THIS CONTEXT , PUBLIC SERVICE IN DESC-PARTICULAR BE DESC-VERY DESC-IMPORTANT TO X-WE ."
X-YOU HAVE AGREE TO SUBMIT PROPOSAL FOR FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE .

X-YOU SPEAK ABOUT DESC-ECONOMIC CRISIS AND DESC-ALSO ABOUT GREECE AND DESC-OR COUNTRY WHICH BE IN DIFFICULTY .

X-WE NEED COMMISSION TO CALL FOR SE THING WITH DESC-POWERFUL VOICE .
X-IT BE ABOUT PREVENT SE THING FROM HAPPEN AS DESC-FAR AS DESC-POSSIBLE BY MONITOR DESC-ECONOMIC AND DESC-BUDGETARY CHANGE .
"DESC-ONCE DESC-AGAIN , X-I CAN HEAR GOVERNMENT SAY THAT X-WE CAN DESC-NOT INVESTIGATE X-Y STATISTICS OR X-Y DESC-BUDGETARY PROCEDURE ."
THIS BE DESC-NOT DESC-ACCEPTABLE .
WHY DO GOVERNMENT HAVE TO KEEP X-Y STATISTICS AND X-Y BUDGET PROCEDURE SECRET ?
"COURSE , GOVERNMENT MUST HAVE DESC-CERTAIN FREEDOM ."
"MR BARROSO , X-WE BE DESC-READY TO ENTER INTO DESC-SPECIAL PARTNERSHIP THAT X-YOU REFER TO ."
"DESC-HOWEVER , THIS PARTNERSHIP MUST BE BASE ON DESC-STRONG POSITION FOR PARLIAMENT AND FOR COMMISSION ."
"IN DAY TO COME , X-WE WILL BE NEGOTIATE ON FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT ."
"X-IT SPECIFY SOME DETAIL , BUT DESC-DECISIVE FACTOR BE SPIRIT BEHIND X-IT ."
THIS BE WHY COMMISSION MUST HAVE DESC-POWERFUL VOICE .
"DESC-HOWEVER , X-WE MUST BOTH FIGHT FOR DESC-STRONG EUROPE ."
"THIS BE DESC-VERY DESC-IMPORTANT , DESC-PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT DESC-RECENT BEHAVIOR SOME HEAD GOVERNMENT ."
"ON DESC-FINANCIAL REGULATION DESC-FIRST ALL , X-I DESC-FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT MR BARNIER BE TRY TO DO ."
X-I WOULD DESC-VERY DESC-MUCH LIKE X-IT IF X-WE WORK ON CONCRETE PROJECT ALONG THOSE LINE .
X-I CAN DESC-NOT SEE ANY DESC-SUCH PROJECT IN THIS PROGRAM TODAY .

"AT DESC-PRESENT , X-WE HAVE 28 000 FLIGHT EACH DAY IN EUROPEAN UNION ."
THIS DESC-REALLY BE TIME TO REVIVE THIS EUROPE RAILWAY THAT HAVE BE SPEAK ABOUT FOR DECADE .

"ALTHOUGH X-IT BE WORD THAT BE NO DESC-LONGER USE , X-WE NEED TO WORK TOWARDS DESC-FISCAL CONVERGENCE ."
X-I BE THINK IN DESC-PARTICULAR ISSUE DESC-CORPORATE TAXATION .
"DESC-MOREOVER , X-WE WILL NEED TO WORK ON DESC-OWN RESOURCE FOR EU BUDGET ."
X-I BELIEVE THAT SE WOULD BE DESC-POWERFUL ACT THAT MIGHT DESC-WELL PUT X-WE DESC-BACK ON PATH TO GROWTH .
X-WE BE TALK DESC-HERE ABOUT EUROPEAN DESC-SOCIAL MODEL THAT X-WE WANT AND THAT X-WE LOVE .
X-WE WILL HAVE TO WORK ON THIS .

DESC-EVEN INTRODUCTION HAVE TITLEA DESC-NEW ERA .
"DESC-HOWEVER , X-I BE DESC-NOT DESC-SURE THAT DETAIL UNDERNEATH SE DESC-MAJOR HEAD DO JUSTICE TO THIS DESC-POSITIVE SOUND APPROACH ."
THIS BE DESC-STILL ALL ABOUT CLIMATE CRISIS AND DESC-FINANCIAL AND DESC-ECONOMIC CRISIS .
THIS MEAN THAT X-WE BE FACE DESC-MAJOR CHALLENGE .

WHAT COULD PROBLEM BE DESC-HERE ?
X-WE WANT ANSWER TO SE QUESTION .
LET X-I GIVE EXAMPLE .
"IF X-I DO DESC-SO , X-I WOULD DESC-NOT BE PAY TRAVEL EXPENSE OR ANY DESC-OR COMPENSATION ."
DESC-RE BE DESC-STILL AREA WHERE X-WE NEED TO GET DESC-BACK ON TO DESC-RIGHT TRACK .
X-WE WILL RETURN TO SE IN NEXT YEAR X-POSS REPORT .
"MR PRESIDENT , LADY AND GENTLEMAN , X-I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN WITH WORD THANKS ."
X-I DESC-ALSO OWE THANKS TO X-MY FELLOW MEMBER WHOSE PROPOSE AMENDMENT CONTRIBUTE TO REFINE REPORT .
"THAT BE DESC-POSSIBLE DESC-ONLY IF X-WE DESC-ALSO PUT IN PLACE DESC-RELIABLE , DESC-SOLID , DESC-INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM ."
DESC-INSTITUTIONAL INDEPENDENCE BE DESC-IMPORTANT GUARANTEE DESC-PROPERLY FUNCTION DESC-INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM .
THIS BE GUARANTEE OBJECTIVITY AND WAY TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH DESC-INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING RULE AND DESC-BEST PRACTICE .
"STANDARD IN X-MSELVES DO DESC-NOT , DESC-HOWEVER , GUARANTEE DESC-EFFECTIVE DESC-INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM ."
DESC-RE BE IMPROVEMENT IN 2009 IN THIS REGARD .
X-WE REJECT ALL PROPOSAL THAT WOULD REDUCE DESC-POLITICAL GROUPSINDEPENDENCE .
X-WE BE CONVINCE THAT INDEPENDENCE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT X-POSS GROUP BE INSEPARABLE FROM X-Y DESC-FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY .
GROUP DESC-PROGRESSIVE ALLIANCE DESC-SOCIALIST AND DEMOCRAT PERFORM X-ITS WORK IN DESC-FULL AWARENESS THIS RESPONSIBILITY .
"IF DESC-OR DESC-POLITICAL GROUP WISH TO IMPROVE X-Y DESC-OWN ACTIVITY , LET X-Y DO DESC-SO ."
"MR PRESIDENT , X-I BE DESC-GREAT FAN BRITISH ROCK BAND GENESIS ."
HOW CAN THIS BE PREVENT ?
"DESC-INCIDENTALLY , X-I BE DESC-PLEASED THAT COUNCIL BE DESC-STILL DESC-HERE ."
X-I BE AT LOSS TO UNDERSTAND WHY X-Y PERSIST IN OBSTRUCT THIS .
"DESC-FAIR BE DESC-FAIR , DESC-HOWEVER , AND DESC-GREATER TRANSPARENCY BE DESC-ALSO NEED IN X-WE DESC-OWN PARLIAMENT ."
X-MY DESC-FINAL POINT CONCERN DESC-MUTUAL RELATION BETWEEN COUNCIL AND PARLIAMENT .
X-I SHALL HAVE ANOR OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT DESC-LATER .
X-I SHOULD LIKE TO RAISE DESC-FEW ISSUE .
DESC-FIRST CONCERN COMMISSION X-POSS DISCHARGE .
RAPPORTEUR MR LIBERADZKUS SET DESC-FORTH DESC-NEW OPTION DESC-VERY DESC-CLEARLY IN NUMBER PARAGRAPH .

"DESC-YET THIS BE NO PROBLEM , LADY AND GENTLEMAN ."
"DESC-TOGER WITH MR GEIER , X-I HAVE TABLE NUMBER DELETE AMENDMENT ."

ONE EXAMPLE BE COMMISSION X-POSS ACCOUNT .

BE THIS DESC-ACCEPTABLE ?
X-WE KNOW ALL EXCUSE .
"COMMISSION SAY X-IT BE FAULT MEMBER STATE , BECAUSE X-Y BE DESC-RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTROL ."
"MEMBER STATE SAY COMMISSION BE TO BLAME , BECAUSE RULE BE DESC-FAR DESC-TOO COMPLEX ."
BLAME BE PASS FROM PILLAR TO POST .
X-I AGREE WITH THOSE WHO SAY THAT DESC-FUNDAMENTAL DESC-STRUCTURAL CHANGE BE NEED TO CHANGE THIS SITUATION .
X-WE MUST DESC-REFORE USE DISCHARGE TO PUSH THROUGH DESC-SUCH CHANGE .
DESC-SUCH PRESSURE MUST DESC-ALSO BE EXERT ON COUNCIL .
"IN APRIL DESC-LAST YEAR , PARLIAMENT REFUSE TO DISCHARGE COUNCIL X-POSS ACCOUNT FOR 2007 BY DESC-LARGE MAJORITY ."
"TODAY , X-WE HAVE TO STATE THAT SE CHANGE HAVE DESC-NOT TAKE PLACE ."
LET X-I GIVE SPECIFIC EXAMPLE .
X-WE MUST DESC-REFORE ASK COUNCIL DESC-OBVIOUS QUESTION .
WHAT BE ALL THIS TRAVEL MONEY SPEND ON ?
WHICH COUNTRY BE BENEFIT FROM X-IT ?
"COUNCIL BE DESC-HAPPY TO ANSWER DESC-INFORMALLY , OFF RECORD ."

"WHEN SITUATION HAVE DESC-NOT CHANGE BY NOVEMBER , THIS PARLIAMENT TAKE DECISION TO DISCHARGE COUNCIL ."
"DESC-NOW DESC-AGAIN , ALL CANNON BE DESC-DIRECT TO COUNCIL AND POSTPONEMENT BE BE PROPOSE ."
BE X-WE BE DESC-SERIOUS ABOUT X-WE RESPONSIBILITY OR BE X-WE PLAY POLITICS DESC-HERE ?
"BE DISCHARGE DESC-INTERINSTITUTIONAL GAME , AS HAVE BE SAY IN PAST ?"
CAN TAXPAYER TOLERATE THIS GAME DESC-ANYMORE ?

X-IT BE DESC-UP TO PARLIAMENT TO MAKE THIS ONE X-ITS PREROGATIVE .
ANTI AMERICANISM BE DESC-NOT DESC-COMMON CAUSE IN EUROPE .

X-IT BE DESC-NOT ABOUT THAT .
RETENTION PERIOD FOR DATUM HAVE DESC-ALSO BE MENTION .
DATUM MUST DESC-ALWAYS BE RETAIN WITH OBJECTIVE AND IN RELATION TO SPECIFIC PERSON .

AMERICAN HAVE SHOW DESC-VERY DESC-OPEN ATTITUDE DESC-SO DESC-FAR .
THAT BE DESC-VERY DESC-IMPORTANT DISCUSSION .
X-IT NEED TO BE EXPLORE IN DEPTH WITHIN EUROPE .
"COURSE , THAT WILL DESC-NOT BE PART NEGOTIATION ."
DESC-SO THIS BE PARALLEL DISCUSSION .

PASSENGER NAME RECORD PNR DEBATE
NEXT ITEM BE COUNCIL AND COMMISSION STATEMENT ON PASSENGER NAME RECORD PNR .
COUNCIL HAVE DESC-REFORE ASK COMMISSION TO PUT DESC-FORWARD DESC-GENERAL GUIDELINE DOCUMENT IN THIS RESPECT .
"IN THAT RESPECT , X-IT WILL , COURSE , TAKE ACCOUNT PARLIAMENT X-POSS WISH , AS DESC-ALWAYS ."
X-I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THREE ITEM IN X-IT .
"SE , X-I BELIEVE , BE THREE DESC-IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE ."
"X-Y BE IN MOTION FOR RESOLUTION AND , IN THAT RESPECT , X-WE AGREE WITH MOTION ."
X-Y USE DESC-SUCH DATUM TO COMBAT TERRORISM AND DESC-OR DESC-SERIOUS CRIME .
"TWO SE AGREEMENT , WITH X-WE AND AUSTRALIUM , BE BEFORE X-YOU FOR CONSENT TO CONCLUDE X-Y ."
X-I THINK THAT BE DESC-WISE STRATEGY .
"IN X-YOU RESOLUTION , X-YOU DESC-ALSO REFER TO PNR AGREEMENT WITH CANADA ."
THAT AGREEMENT BE LINK TO SET CANADIAN COMMITMENT AND COMMISSION ADEQUACY DECISION .
SE DOCUMENT EXPIRE ON 22 SEPTEMBER DESC-LAST YEAR AND DESC-NEW AGREEMENT SHOULD DESC-REFORE BE RENEGOTIATE WITH CANADA .
"FOR DESC-PRACTICAL REASON , X-IT BE DESC-NOT DESC-POSSIBLE TO DO THIS BEFORE SEPTEMBER DESC-200HOWEVER , THIS DO DESC-NOT DIMINISH LEVEL PROTECTION PNR DATUM TRANSFER TO CANADA ."
"IN CONCLUSION , X-I DESC-WELCOME THIS RESOLUTION AND X-I WILL ACT ACCORD TO SE RECOMMENDATION ."
X-I BE LOOK DESC-FORWARD TO WORK DESC-FURR WITH X-YOU ON SE ISSUE .
"IN DESC-DIGITAL AGE , X-WE DESC-ALSO HAVE TO ENSURE DESC-SPECIAL PROTECTION AS REGARD INFORMATION SELF DETERMINATION AND PRIVACY ."
"AS REGARD USE PNR DATUM , X-WE SHOULD DESC-ALSO INCLUDE DESC-SERIOUS CRIME ."
"IN X-MY OPINION , THIS WOULD DESC-ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO PROTECT DESC-PERSONAL RIGHTS THOSE AFFECT ."
THAT WOULD DESC-CERTAINLY DESC-ALSO BE STEP TOWARDS CONFRONT DESC-GLOBALISED CRIME ON DESC-GLOBAL SCALE .
"MADAM PRESIDENT , DESC-RE BE DESC-FEW DESC-BASIC THING X-I WOULD LIKE TO SAY ABOUT THIS AGREEMENT ."
"DESC-RE BE , BY ALL MEANS , SIMILARITY WITH SWIFT , BUT DESC-ALSO DIFFERENCE ."
THAT BE DESC-QUITE DESC-CLEAR .
DESC-RE BE DESC-STILL DESC-SIGNIFICANT OBJECTION TO THIS AGREEMENT .
X-I WILL GO INTO DETAIL DESC-ONCE MORE DESC-SHORTLY .
THAT BE WHY X-I BE DESC-NOT DESC-HAPPY WHEN X-WE SPEAK ABOUT POSTPONE VOTE .
"DESC-HOWEVER , UNLIKE SWIFT , DESC-RE BE DESC-DEFINITELY DESC-GOOD REASON FOR THIS POSTPONEMENT ."
PNR COVER 19 INDIVIDUAL PIECE DATUM .
THAT BE DESC-CRUCIAL QUESTION .
X-WE DESC-ALSO HAVE TO CHECK WHAT LEVEL PROTECTION BE AFFORD TO DATUM THAT BE TRANSMIT .
X-WE KNOW THAT REGULATION IN BOTH AGREEMENT WITH USA AND AUSTRALIUM BE DESC-VERY DESC-DIFFERENT .
X-WE DESC-ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER IN DETAIL QUESTION HOW THIS DATUM BE TO BE USE .
"DESC-ORIGINALLY , X-IT BE DESC-ALWAYS SAY THAT X-IT BE ABOUT COMBATE TERRORISM ."
"DESC-NOW DESC-HOWEVER , X-IT BE DESC-ALSO ABOUT DESC-SERIOUS CRIME ."
THIS CAN BE DISCUSS .
"DESC-HOWEVER , X-WE MUST GO INTO DESC-GREAT DETAIL DESC-HERE ."
"X-WE KNOW THAT DESC-EVEN WITHIN EUROPEAN UNION X-ITSELF , DESC-LEGAL SYSTEM AND DESC-LEGAL CULTURE VARY DESC-GREATLY ."
"DESC-OFFICIALLY , X-WE DESC-STILL DO DESC-NOT HAVE SE RESULT DESC-YET ."
THAT BE IN FEBRUARY .
X-IT BE DESC-VERY DESC-IMPORTANT TO CREATE UNIFORM AGREEMENT .
ISSUE DATUM MUST BE REVIEW DESC-AGAIN .
TODAY X-WE CONSIDER REQUEST FOR CONSENT BY COUNCIL ON TWO AGREEMENT WITH X-WE AND AUSTRALIUM .
THIS HOUSE HAVE DESC-ALWAYS BE DESC-HIGHLY DESC-CRITICAL USE AND TRANSFER PNR DATUM .
X-IT WOULD DESC-REFORE BE DESC-INCONSISTENT WITH X-WE DESC-EARLIER POSITION TO GIVE CONSENT WITHOUT DESC-FURR ADO .
THIS BE DESC-REALLY KEY TO EVERYTHING .
X-WE DESC-SPECIFICALLY NEED TO LOOK AT APUS DATUM AND ESTA IN THIS CONTEXT .
THAT BE SOMETHING DESC-COMPLETELY DESC-DIFFERENT AND X-WE NEED TO DISTINGUISH DESC-VERY DESC-CAREFULLY .
X-WE NEED TO MAKE DESC-VERY DESC-CLEAR WHAT X-IT BE THAT X-WE BE TALK ABOUT .
ANY USE PNR MUST BE IN LINE WITH EU DATUM PROTECTION STANDARD .
X-IT BE X-WE DESC-PRIME RESPONSIBILITY TO REPRESENT INTEREST X-WE DESC-OWN EUROPEAN CITIZEN .
X-Y HAVE DESC-RIGHT TO KNOW THAT X-WE UPHOLD EUROPEAN LAW IN DESC-INTERNATIONAL RELATION AND IN X-WE DESC-INTERNAL POLICY .
X-I BELIEVE WITH DESC-FORTHCOMING PNR PACKAGE X-WE HAVE DESC-UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO GET X-IT DESC-RIGHT .
X-I DO DESC-NOT KNOW WHER X-YOU HAVE DESC-EVER SEE FILM MINORITY REPORT .
"IF DESC-NOT , DESC-N X-I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT X-YOU WATCH X-IT ."
DESC-SO CALL PRE COP TRY TO PREDICT FUTURE BY DESC-CONSTANTLY MONITOR PEOPLE X-POSS FEELING AND MANNERS BEHAVIOR .
DESC-GREAT !
DESC-SEEMINGLY DESC-INFALLIBLE SYSTEM THAT DESC-FINALLY PROVIDE SECURITY .
DESC-N CHIEF INVESTIGATOR X-HIMSELF BE TARGET AND HOUSE CARD COLLAPSE .
"MADAM PRESIDENT , X-I BE DESC-NOT DESC-ILLUSTRIOUS FILM CRITIC , AS DESC-PREVIOUS SPEAKER BE ."
X-I WOULD DESC-NOT LIKE X-WE DEBATE TO BE DEBATE ABOUT CINEMA .
THIS CAN BE MATTER LIFE AND DEATH FOR SE PEOPLE .
"X-IT CONCERN FREEDOM MOVEMENT , BUT X-IT DESC-ALSO CONCERN DESC-INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION AND X-WE DESC-CIVIL RIGHTS ."
MT X-I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THREE BRIEF COMMENT .
"X-I BELIEVE THAT ONE DESC-SUCH LESSON BE LEARN BY PARLIAMENT , DESC-NAMELY THAT DESC-GREATER POWER BRING ABOUT DESC-GREATER RESPONSIBILITY ."
THIS BE SOMETHING THAT X-WE WOULD DO DESC-WELL TO EMPHASISE .
"DESC-SECONDLY , BE THIS AGREEMENT DESC-IMPORTANT OR DESC-NOT ?"
"IN X-MY OPINION , X-IT BE DESC-VERY DESC-IMPORTANT DESC-INDEED ."
X-WE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM BE DESC-IMPORTANT FOR X-WE CITIZENSSECURITY AND X-WE CARRY DESC-GREAT RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS REGARD .
X-MY DESC-THIRD POINT DO THIS AGREEMENT RAISE ISSUE ON DATUM PROTECTION AND CITIZENSPRIVACY ?
"DESC-REFORE , X-I BELIEVE THAT RESOLUTION BEFORE X-WE BE DESC-GOOD AND DESC-WELL DESC-BALANCED ."
"DESC-REFORE , X-I WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE RAPPORTEUR THIS RESOLUTION FOR X-SHE WORK ON THIS DOSSIER ."
"BOTH BE DESC-IMPORTANT , COURSE , AND DESC-CAREFUL BALANCE NEED TO BE STRIKE BETWEEN X-Y ."
DESC-JUST ABOUT EVERYONE WILL TRAVEL BY AIR DESC-SOONER OR DESC-LATER .
"DESC-EVIDENTLY , DESC-ONLY DESC-ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL BE DESC-POSSIBLE AGAINST DESC-SUCH BAN ON ENTER X-WE TERRITORY ."
"NL TENSION HAVE DESC-INDEED EASE DESC-LITTLE , LADY AND GENTLEMAN ."
SOMETHING NEED TO BE DO ABOUT THIS .
X-WE NEED DISCLOSURE REGULATION LIKE USA X-POSS PRIVACY ACT .
SE MUST BE DESC-OPEN TO EUROPEAN CITIZEN .
WAY TO DESC-LEGAL ACTION MUST DESC-LIKEWISE STAND DESC-OPEN TO X-Y .
STANDARD THAT X-WE WANT HAVE BE SET OUT DESC-CLEARLY IN DESC-JOINT RESOLUTION .
THAT HAPPEN DESC-LAST YEAR BEFORE CHRISTMAS .
"DESC-HOWEVER , THOSE WHO DECIDE WHER X-HE COULD FLY OR DESC-NOT DO DESC-NOT HAVE DESC-NECESSARY INFORMATION TO HAND ."
X-I BELIEVE THAT X-WE DESC-ALREADY KNOW WHO POSE THREAT .
PROBLEM BE GET DATUM TO WHERE X-WE NEED X-IT IN ORDER TO PREVENT THREAT .
"DESC-UNFORTUNATELY , THIS PROPOSAL BE DESC-NOT TAKE DESC-UP BY EUROPEAN INTERIOR MINISTER ."
"DESC-INSTEAD , DESC-RE BE PROPOSAL TO BUILD DESC-NEW DATUM SET AND GAR DESC-NEW DATUM ."
"X-IT DESC-OFTEN SEEM TO X-I THAT FOR INTERIOR MINISTER , COLLECT DESC-NEW DATUM BE DESC-EASY OPTION ."
X-I HOPE DESC-NOW THAT X-WE WILL DESC-SOON BE DESC-ABLE TO FLY DESC-SAFELY DESC-AGAIN .
X-I HAVE NO QUARREL WITH THAT .
WHAT ACTION WILL X-YOU TAKE TO PREVENT PNR DATUM BE USE IN PROFILE AND DEFINITION RISK FACTOR ?
"TO THIS , X-I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT NO DATUM COLLECTION SYSTEM BE DESC-SUFFICIENT IN X-ITSELF ."
X-WE CAN DESC-NOT PREVENT ATTEMPT DESC-TERRORIST ATTACK WITHOUT SOUND DATUM EXCHANGE AND COOPERATION INTELLIGENCE SERVICE .
DESC-STILL DESC-LESS DO X-I WANT TO SEE X-WE DESC-FUNDAMENTAL PRIVACY RIGHTS BE VIOLATE .
THAT WOULD BE REWARD TASK FOR BOTH SIDE AND WOULD HELP X-WE IN DESC-MANY WAY .
"DESC-REFORE , DEFINITION TERMSERIOUS CRIMEUS DESC-VITAL ."
DESC-CLEAR CORRECTION DATUM MUST BE DESC-POSSIBLE .
"FOR X-WE , DATUM PROTECTION MUST BE ACTIVATE , DESC-ORWISE THIS AGREEMENT BE NON DESC-STARTER ."
RO PROTECTION DESC-PERSONAL DATUM BE ONE DESC-FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS EUROPEAN CITIZEN .
THAT BE WHAT MR FAYOT MENTION WHAT MEASURE OUGHT TO BE ADOPT ?
X-I THINK DEBATE X-WE HAVE ON SWIFT MAY CLARIFY MATTER .
X-I BELIEVE PRINCIPLE X-WE DISCUSS DESC-N AND AGREE UPON SHOULD BE DESC-PRESENT DESC-HERE .
"DESC-LASTLY , X-MY DESC-THIRD COMMENT BE CONNECT WITH DESC-PREVIOUS ONE ."
X-I THINK THAT BE DESC-FALSE DILEMMA .
"ON CONTRARY , X-I BELIEVE THAT SECURITY AND FREEDOM BE TWO PRINCIPLE THAT ENHANCE EACH DESC-OR ."
"MADAM PRESIDENT , DESC-YES , X-I HAVE SEE FILM MINORITY REPORT ."
"DESC-HOPEFULLY , X-WE WILL HAVE DESC-GOOD RESULT ."
X-I HAVE LISTEN DESC-CAREFULLY TO DEBATE .
X-I HAVE READ X-YOU RESOLUTION .
X-I THINK X-IT BE DESC-VERY DESC-BALANCED AND DESC-WISE RESOLUTION .
X-I THINK THIS BE DESC-IMPORTANT AND X-I THINK X-IT WILL INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND DEPTH X-WE DISCUSSION .
"THANK X-YOU , COMMISSIONER , FOR THIS COLLABORATION X-I HOPE X-IT WILL BE DESC-FRUITFUL ."
DEBATE BE DESC-CLOSE .
VOTE WILL TAKE PLACE DURING DESC-FIRST PART SESSION IN MAY .
BAN ON USE CYANIDE MINING TECHNOLOGY DEBATE
X-I WOULD MENTION DESC-JUST DECISION REGARD BIODIVERSITY OR WATER FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE .
EU X-POSS WATER FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE MAKE MEMBER STATE DESC-RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECT WATER QUALITY AND PREVENT POLLUTION .
BE THIS DESC-WORTHY GOAL ?
"DESC-YES , X-IT BE ."
BE X-IT X-WE RESPONSIBILITY TO DO EVERYTHING X-WE CAN IN ORDER TO REACH THIS GOAL ?
DESC-CLEARLY X-IT BE .
BE DESC-RE ANY MINING TECHNOLOGY THAT ENDANGER X-WE WATER AND X-WE ENVIRONMENT ?
"DESC-UNFORTUNATELY , DESC-RE BE ."
"DESC-MOREOVER , DESC-RE BE ONE DESC-EXTREMELY DESC-DANGEROUS AND , AT DESC-SAME TIME , DESC-OBSOLETE TECHNOLOGY IN DESC-PARTICULAR ."
"LADY AND GENTLEMAN , DESC-PRESENT MOMENT BE ONE THAT BE BOTH DESC-FORTUNATE AND PRESS ."
THIS REPRESENT DESC-SERIOUS THREAT TO X-WE ENVIRONMENT .
DESC-YET THIS BE RESULT THIS DESC-OBSOLETE TECHNOLOGY .
"TIME BE DESC-RIPE , DESC-DISTINGUISHED FELLOW MEMBER , TO TAKE ACTION ."
LET X-WE DESC-NOT WAIT FOR DESC-NEW CATASTROPHE TO WARN X-WE THIS .
"X-I BELIEVE THAT , GIVE SERIOUSNESS MATTER , THIS BE DESC-ABSOLUTELY DESC-JUSTIFIED ."
X-I WOULD ASK X-MY FELLOW MEMBER TO CONTINUE X-Y SUPPORT THROUGH DESC-FINAL STAGE DECISION MAKE PROCESS .
"MADAM PRESIDENT , DESC-HONORABLE MEMBER , X-MY COLLEAGUE , COMMISSIONER PIEBALG EXCUSE X-HIMSELF ."
DESC-FULL ACCIDENT PREVENTION POLICY BE REQUIRE FOR FACILITY IN WHICH DESC-TOXIC SUBSTANCE BE TREAT OR STORE .
DESC-CLEAR INFORMATION REQUIREMENT BE INCLUDE IN DIRECTIVE IF TRAN BOUNDARY IMPACT BE EXPECT .
"THIS LEGISLATION DESC-ALSO INCORPORATE REQUIREMENT FOR CLOSURE EXTRACTION FACILITY , AND FOR AFTER CLOSURE ."
"IN MOST EUROPEAN DEPOSIT , GOLD BE BIND WITH DESC-OR METAL MEAN THAT SEPARATION METHOD BE REQUIRE ."
"DESC-EVEN WITHOUT CONSIDER USE CYANIDE , MINING FOR GOLD BE DESC-FAR FROM KIND TO ENVIRONMENT ."
DESC-SAME AMOUNT CAN BE OBTAIN THROUGH RECYCLE DESC-APPROXIMATELY 5 KG DESC-OLD DESC-MOBILE PHONE .
THIS BE WHY RESOURCE EFFICIENCY BE PRIORITY FOR THIS COMMISSION .
DESC-NOT ALL USE SE DESC-DANGEROUS CYANIDE TECHNOLOGY .
"AS COMMISSIONER HAVE DESC-CORRECTLY ESTABLISH , X-WE HAVE LEARN FROM THIS ACCIDENT ."
"DESC-HOWEVER , X-I BELIEVE COMMISSION SHOULD DRAW DESC-FURR CONCLUSION IN VIEW THIS DESC-VERY DESC-DANGEROUS TECHNOLOGY ."
"ON DESC-MANY OCCASION , EUROPE HAVE COMMIT X-ITSELF TO ADHERE TO DESC-HIGH DESC-ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION STANDARD ."
", PLAN INVOLVE DESC-EXPONENTIALLY DESC-LARGER GOLD MINE ."
DESC-RE BE DESC-NUMEROUS PROBLEM SURROUND INVESTMENT .
DESC-RE BE NO GUARANTEE THAT SURFACE EXTRACTION ACCOMPANY INVESTMENT WILL DESC-NOT TRANSFORM LANDSCAPE .
DESC-GREAT DEAL POISON WILL BE RELEASE INTO ENVIRONMENT .
"EXPECT LIFETIME MINE BE DESC-ONLY 20 YEAR , AND X-IT WILL CREATE DESC-SCARCELY ANY JOB ."
DESC-RE BE NO GUARANTEE THAT INVESTOR WILL RESTORE ENVIRONMENT AFTER MINING BE FINISH .
X-WE DO DESC-NOT ACCEPT WHAT COMMISSION REPRESENTATIVE HAVE SAY ABOUT DESC-RE BE NO DESC-SAFE TECHNIQUE .
DESC-RE BE PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE FROM DESC-OR COUNTRY WITH DESC-TRAGIC RESULT .
"DESC-ALSO , DESC-RE BE QUESTION TURKISH SHORE AND RELATE THREAT TO AEGEAN ."
DESC-RE BE DESC-ALSO DESC-SIMILAR PLAN IN DESC-OR COUNTRY .
"DESC-HOWEVER , DESC-HUNGARY , AS X-WE DESC-ALREADY KNOW , DECIDE DESC-JUST DESC-LAST DECEMBER TO BAN ALL CYANIDE BASE MINING WORK ."
ONE MEMBER REFER DESC-EARLIER TO MINE PROGRAM BE PREPARE AT DESC-PRESENT IN GREECE .
"X-WE BE DESC-CERTAIN THAT CITIZEN WILL DESC-OBVIOUSLY REACT , BUT X-WE DESC-TOO MUST ACT ."
X-IT BE DESC-WELL KNOW AMONG DESC-PROFESSIONAL THAT CYANIDE BE ONE MOST DESC-TOXIC ALL CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE .
X-IT GET INTO ORGANISM BY INHALATION THROUGH DESC-UNDAMAGED SKIN OR AFTER USE .
"AT DESC-SUFFICIENT CONCENTRATION , DEATH FOLLOW IN DESC-FEW SECONDS OR MINUTE ."
"DESC-SOMETIMES , DESC-RE BE DESC-HUMAN ERROR AND DESC-SOMETIMES NATURE SPRING SURPRISE ."
"IN NOVEMBER 2005 , MEP AND MEMBER STATE ADOPT MINING WASTE DIRECTIVE ."
MINE DEVELOPMENT IN ALBA COUNTY . RO ?
"IN ADDITION , DESC-RE BE DESC-NOT DESC-EVEN ANY EUROPEAN LEGISLATION ON AIR QUALITY FOR DESC-SUCH EMISSION ."
"AT DESC-SAME TIME , DESC-VERY DESC-MANY TONNE THIS DESC-TOXIC ROCK BE CREATE ."
"EL MADAM PRESIDENT , COMMISSIONER , AFTER CHERNOBYL , X-WE ALL UNDERSTAND DESC-NUCLEAR RISK ."
CONTAMINATION FOOD CHAIN IN AREA DESC-DIRECTLY AFFECT BE DESC-LONG TERM .
DESC-HUNGARY REPORT 1 367 TONNE DESC-DEAD FISH .
"OVER 100 PERSON , DESC-MAINLY CHILD , BE POISON FROM EAT CONTAMINATE FISH AND BE TREAT DESC-IMMEDIATELY ."
TIME WHEN X-WE SACRIFICE DESC-LOCAL ENVIRONMENT AND X-WE CITIZENSHEALTH FOR JOB BE DESC-LONG GO .
"EL MADAM PRESIDENT , COMMISSION , GOLD BE SIT DESC-RE X-IT CAN DESC-NOT ESCAPE ."
TECHNOLOGY WHICH USE CYANIDE BE DESC-HAZARDOUS .
"DESC-RE BE REGULATION , STANDARD AND NORM IN PLACE TO PREVENT ACCIDENT ."
X-WE DO DESC-NOT NEED TO APPLY BAN X-WE DESC-SIMPLY HAVE TO OBSERVE RULE .
RESOLUTION MENTION 30 ACCIDENT OVER DESC-LAST 25 YEAR .
"CYANIDE TECHNOLOGY BE USE TO OBTAIN VARIETY PRODUCT , INCLUDE DESC-EVEN DESC-PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT AND VITAMIN ."
"RESOLUTION DESC-ONLY DISCUSS MINING AND , DESC-SPECIFICALLY , GOLD PRODUCTION ."
WHY ?
REASON BE THAT PROBLEM BE DESC-NOT DESC-ACTUALLY WITH CYANIDE BUT WITH GOLD .
DESC-ONLY FUTURE PROJECT X-I BE DESC-AWARE IN EUROPE INVOLVE MINING GOLD BE IN ROMANIUM .
X-WE BE DESC-AWARE DESC-LEGAL MEASURE WHICH EUROPEAN UNION HAVE ADOPT .
CONTINUE TO MOBILISE PUBLIC OPINION IN EUROPE BE DESC-ALSO PART X-WE MISSION .
FINLAND BE DESC-BIG GOLD PRODUCER BY EUROPEAN STANDARD .
DESC-NOW X-WE HAVE TO REMEMBER ONE DESC-SCIENTIFIC FACT GOLD DO DESC-NOT DISSOLVE IN LIQUID DESC-OR THAN CYANIDE .
"DESC-ALSO INVOLVE CYANIDE , BUT IN CLOSE PROCESS ."
CYANIDE USE IN PROCESS ENRICH SLURRY BE REUSE AND DESC-RESIDUAL CYANIDE BE DESTROY AFTER PROCESS .
DESC-EVEN DESC-RESIDUAL CYANIDE IN WATER RECOVER FROM TAIL DAM BE PURIFY .
"BACTERIUM BASE EXTRACTION WOULD BE MORE NATURE DESC-FRIENDLY , BUT X-IT BE DESC-NOT DESC-YET USE FOR GOLD ."
MICROBIAL PURIFICATION DESC-RESIDUAL CYANIDE BE BE DEVELOP WITH DESC-GOOD RESULT AND X-I DESC-STRONGLY RECOMMEND MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION .
"IN ANY CASE , EXPERT SAY THAT USE DESC-SUCH ALTERNATIVE AGENT POSE DESC-GREATER RISK THAN USE CYANIDE ."
HU ALLOW OR BAN MINING VENTURE THAT USE CYANIDE RAISE DESC-SENSITIVE ISSUE IN DESC-CERTAIN MEMBER STATE .
"IN THIS AREA , DESC-RE CAN BE NO QUESTION DESC-SMALL OR DESC-LARGE RISK ."
TECHNOLOGY BE DESC-ALSO DESC-SIGNIFICANT DESC-RE .
"ANOR DESC-IMPORTANT MATTER BE USE MICROBE , WHICH BE DESC-NEW INNOVATION ."
X-I BELIEVE X-WE NEED THIS CHANGE IN ATTITUDE THROUGHOUT EUROPE .
X-WE MUST BE DESC-AWARE FACT THAT X-WE BE IN PROCESS DEVELOP DESC-NEW TECHNOLOGY .
X-I DESC-REFORE DESC-REALLY MUST ASK FOR DESC-LONG TERM APPROACH DESC-HERE .
"DESC-HOWEVER , BAN SE SUBSTANCE MUST DESC-NOT BE VIEW AS DESC-ONLY SOLUTION ."
"DESC-TOXIC , DESC-HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE BE USE IN DESC-MANY DESC-INDUSTRIAL PROCESS DESC-OR THAN MINING ."
"DESC-HOWEVER , X-Y CAUSE BE DESC-SIMILAR TAIL POND WHICH COLLAPSE ."
MORE THAN 90 % GOLD AND SILVER PRODUCTION CARRY OUT DESC-GLOBALLY USE CYANIDE BASE TECHNOLOGY FOR EXTRACT METAL .
"DESC-HOWEVER , AS X-WE HAVE HEAR , X-IT BE DESC-HIGHLY DESC-DANGEROUS ."
"FOR THAT REASON , AS TRADE POLITICIAN , X-I WONDER WHAT CAN X-WE DO ABOUT X-IT ?"
"IN EUROPEAN UNION , X-WE DESC-ONLY HAVE LIMIT GOLD MINING CAPACITY ."
GOAL BE TO MAKE DIFFERENCE WORLDWIDE WITH DESC-TECHNICAL INNOVATION .
"DESC-HERE , DESC-RE BE DESC-HIGH TECHNOLOGY , X-I KNOW ."
IN GERMANY DESC-ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY BE DEVELOP THAT WILL HELP TO AVOID CYANIDE IN FUTURE .
X-WE MUST MAKE SE EUROPEAN DESC-HIGH TECHNOLOGY DESC-COMMERCIALLY DESC-VIABLE AND X-WE MUST MAKE X-Y DESC-AFFORDABLE .
X-I SEE DESC-GREAT POTENTIAL FOR TRADE IN THIS .
X-MY DESC-OWN COUNTRY BE AMONG THOSE AFFECT .
"DESPITE THIS , LAW IN DESC-MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRY DESC-STILL ALLOW USE DESC-SUCH TECHNIQUE ."
X-WE DESC-ALSO HAVE DESC-EVEN DESC-HIGHER NUMBER SITE WHERE WORK BE CARRY OUT USE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE .
"DESC-HOWEVER , SUBSTANCE BE USE ON X-WE PLANET WHICH BE THOUSAND TIME MORE DESC-TOXIC THAN CYANIDE ."
"DESC-GENERALLY SPEAKING , IF CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE ENTER WATER , X-Y DESTROY LIFE ."
X-WE HAVE DESC-MANY DESC-DEAD RIVER AROUND WORLD WHICH HAVE DESC-NOT BE TOUCH BY CYANIDE .
"AS EUROPEAN STATE , THIS BE DESC-DEFINITELY PATH WHICH ROMANIUM HAVE CHOOSE TO GO DESC-DOWN ."
EVERY COUNTRY IN WORLD MUST DO DESC-SAME .
"MR PRESIDENT , WITH ALL DESC-DUE RESPECT , CAN X-I SAY THAT THIS DEBATE BE DESC-LARGELY MISDIRECT ."
SUBJECT BEFORE X-WE BE DESC-VERY DESC-CURIOUS MATTER .
X-IT REIGNITE ACCIDENT THAT TAKE PLACE 10 YEAR DESC-AGO .
WHY ?
WHY HAVE DESC-RE BE THIS DESC-LONG SILENCE ?
AND WHY DESC-NOW ?
WHY DEBATE DESC-NOW ?
X-I FIND WHOLE MATTER DESC-UNJUSTIFIED .
"IN X-MY OPINION , AND X-I THINK IN TRUTH , X-IT BE DESC-JUST DESC-POOR DESC-POLITICAL PLOT ."
X-I KNOW X-IT DESC-REALLY DESC-WELL .
THAT BE TRANSLATION ERROR .
X-I BE DESC-FAMILIAR WITH GEOGRAPHY DESC-CENTRAL EUROPE .
"MR PRESIDENT , THANK X-YOU FOR THIS DEBATE ."
NIK GET DESC-FULL ACCOUNT X-IT . THAT MR POTO ?
X-WE SHARE X-YOU CONCERN ABOUT CYANIDE .
"X-IT BE , COURSE , DESC-VERY DESC-DANGEROUS TOXIN AND X-WE BE DESC-AWARE THAT ."

X-I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASISE THAT WORK WILL COURSE DESC-NOT BE FINISH IN JUNE .
"THAT BE WHEN EUROPE 2020 STRATEGY WILL BE LAUNCH , BUT WORK WILL DESC-NOT BE FINISH DESC-N ."
X-IT WILL HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENT AND APPLY THROUGH DESC-NATIONAL REFORM PROGRAM .
"MADAM PRESIDENT , EUROPE HAVE BE DESC-PRESENT WITH DESC-STARK CHOICE ."
"OR X-WE COULD INCREASE EUROPEAN COOPERATION IN DESC-EFFECTIVE WAY , USE ALL TOOL AT X-WE DISPOSAL ."
LET X-I TOUCH BRIEFLY ON MOST X-Y .
"G20 HAVE BE DESC-INSTRUMENTAL IN ADDRESS DESC-FINANCIAL DESC-ECONOMIC CRISIS , IMPROVE GOVERNANCE ON MORE DESC-GLOBAL LEVEL ."
X-WE HAVE TO ADDRESS DESC-GLOBALLY SOME IMBALANCE THAT BE AT ORIGIN THIS CRISIS .
X-WE SHOULD DESC-ALSO ENSURE THAT BURDEN REBALANCING DESC-GLOBAL GROWTH BE SHARE BY ALL G20 MEMBER .
X-IT BE DESC-IMPORTANT THAT EUROPE DESC-PRESENT COORDINATE APPROACH TO GANOR OBJECTIVE WILL BE DRIVE ON WITH DESC-FINANCIAL MARKET REFORM .
X-WE SHOULD STRIVE FOR COORDINATE AND DESC-STRONG APPROACH .
"DESC-GLOBAL AGREEMENT ON BANK STABILITY LEVY , LINK TO CONCRETE RESOLUTION MEASURE , WOULD SEND DESC-STRONG SIGNAL ."
"AS IMF DESC-RECENTLY SUGGEST , THIS COULD BE COMPLEMENT BY TAX ON DESC-FINANCIAL ACTIVITY OR PROFIT ."
X-IT BE GO TO BE DESC-EXTREMELY DESC-DIFFICULT DEBATE .
THAT WILL REQUIRE FLEXIBILITY AND DESC-CREATIVE PRAGMATISM FROM BOTH THIS HOUSE AND FROM COUNCIL .
X-WE HAVE HAVE DESC-SEVERAL OCCASION TO DEBATE X-Y IN THIS HOUSE .
"DESC-EVEN BEFORE X-WE MAKE PROPOSAL , COMMISSION CONSULT X-YOU ABOUT THIS ."
DESC-BETTER COORDINATION X-WE DESC-ECONOMIC POLICY BE CENTER PIECE EUROPE DESC-20EVEN BEFORE THIS GREEK CRISIS X-WE BE SUGGEST AND PROPOSE MORE COORDINATION DESC-ECONOMIC POLICY .
THIS BE DESC-CLEARLY DESC-NECESSARY IN ORDER TO AVOID FUTURE CRISIS .
X-I BE DESC-ALSO DESC-STRONGLY COMMIT TO GET DESC-NUMERICAL TARGET ON FIGHT AGAINST POVERTY AND DESC-SOCIAL EXCLUSION .
X-WE DESC-SIMPLY CAN DESC-NOT ACCEPT CONTINUE SCANDAL 80 MILLION PEOPLE AT RISK POVERTY IN EUROPEAN UNION .
EUROPE 2020 MUST BE DESC-BALANCED PROGRAM .
"MEMBER STATE BE IN PROCESS SET SE DESC-NATIONAL TARGET , IN COOPERATION WITH COMMISSION ."
COMMISSION ISSUE PROPOSAL ON INTEGRATE GUIDELINE DESC-LAST WEEK .
X-Y REFLECT PRIORITY EUROPE 2020 STRATEGY .
X-I THINK THIS BE PROGRESS .
THAT BE WHY X-WE NEED TO DESC-CLOSE THIS DELIVERY GAP THAT PREVAIL UNDER LISBON STRATEGY .
"IF X-WE WANT TO BE DESC-SERIOUS ABOUT DESC-ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE , THAT BE DESC-ONLY WAY TO DO X-IT ."
THIS DESC-REALLY CAN DESC-NOT CONTINUE .
"DESC-THUS , THING MUST BE DO DESC-DIFFERENTLY WITH EU 2020 STRATEGY ."
PARLIAMENT WILL CHALLENGE X-YOU TO DO DESC-SO IF NEED BE .
X-YOU CAN COUNT ON X-WE SUPPORT .
X-IT BE TO BE DESC-WELCOME THAT COUNCIL HAVE SET DESC-UP TASK FORCE .
DESC-RE BE NO TIME TO LOSE .
DO THAT LINK DESC-REALLY MEAN ANYTHING IN PRACTICE ?
HOW CAN ONE THINK THAT X-WE WOULD COMMIT X-OURSELVES FOR NEXT 10 YEAR ?
"BE THAT CHANGE , THOUGH , MR BARROSO ?"
X-WE DESC-ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT WHERE X-WE WANT TO GO .
X-WE CAN DESC-NOT IGNORE X-IT .
X-WE CAN DESC-NOT CONSIDER THAT STRATEGY WITHOUT USE TOOL AT X-WE DISPOSAL .
"AS X-YOU DESC-WELL KNOW , MR BARROSO , X-WE BE DESC-NOT AS DESC-RICH AS ALL THAT ."
"IF X-Y BE DESC-NOT DESC-CLEARLY LINK , X-WE WILL GO DESC-NOWHERE ."
"DESC-FURR , WHEN X-WE LOOK AT POINT DEPARTURE , X-WE HAVE SOME CONCERN ."
"THIS BE DESC-NOT ABOUT GREECE , OR ABOUT ANY DESC-OR MEMBER STATE ."
THIS BE ABOUT DOMINO EFFECT AND ABOUT LACK RESTRICTION ON SPECULATION .
THIS BE DESC-NOT X-WE VISION FUTURE .
THIS BE DESC-NOT TIME .
"X-WE NEED DESC-REAL ACTION , AND X-WE NEED X-IT DESC-NOW ."
LET X-I MAKE COMPARISON .
THAT BE COMPARISON X-WE HAVE TO MAKE .
THAT BE WHY X-WE BE DESC-SO DESC-TOUGH ON GOVERNANCE IN DESC-PARLIAMENTARY RESOLUTION .
LET X-I TAKE SOME EXAMPLE .
X-WE NEGOTIATE DESC-ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN .
MOST X-IT BE DESC-NOT ENFORCE .
"X-WE HAVE DECIDE ON SET PLAN , DESC-NEW ENERGY TECHNOLOGY ."
"X-WE DESC-STILL DO DESC-NOT HAVE 50 % FUNDING FOR SET PLAN , DESC-REAL DESC-STRATEGIC TOOL ."
MOST COST DESC-EFFECTIVE MEANS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS BE TO MOVE DESC-FORWARD WITH STRATEGY FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY .
EXIST LEGISLATION MUST BE STEP DESC-UP BECAUSE X-IT BE DESC-NOT DESC-SUFFICIENT .
"X-WE NEED PROMISE ENERGY EFFICIENCY ACTION PLAN , PROMISE FOR DESC-SO DESC-LONG ."
COUNCIL HAVE TO BE DESC-BOLDER AND STOP BICKER .
X-WE WILL PUT DESC-FORWARD DESC-BOLD RESOLUTION ON DESC-SECOND STEP 2020 STRATEGY .
"AS REGARD GREECE , X-WE BE DESC-NOW BE FORCE TO TAKE LOOK IN MIRROR ."
FROM CRISIS IN GREECE X-WE CAN SEE THAT WHAT HAVE HAPPEN DESC-UP TO DESC-NOW BE DESC-TOTALLY DESC-INADEQUATE .
X-WE CITIZEN HAVE HEAR X-WE DECLARE THAT X-WE BE RESCUE BANK .
X-Y HAVE GRIT X-Y TOOTH AND ACCEPT X-IT .
DESC-NOW X-Y BE PAY PRICE .
PUBLIC FINANCES BE DESC-ALREADY DESC-OVERBURDENED BY SE MEASURE .
X-IT WILL BE DESC-YET ANOR CHALLENGE FOR PUBLIC FINANCES IN DESC-MANY COUNTRY EUROPEAN UNION .
"IN RESPECT PUBLIC FINANCES , X-WE CAN DESC-NOT CARRY ON WAY X-WE HAVE START ."
"IN PAPER THAT X-YOU DESC-PRESENT , X-I DESC-STILL CAN DESC-NOT SEE VISION WHAT BE TO HAPPEN DESC-NOW ."
"IN THAT REGARD , X-WE HAVE DESC-NOT MAKE ANY PROGRESS FOR DESC-MANY YEAR ."
"FOR X-I , CLIMATE BE DESC-SECOND DESC-MAJOR ISSUE ."
"IF X-WE LOOK AT DESC-CURRENT SITUATION , X-IT BE DESC-HIGH TIME X-WE RAISE X-WE TARGET TO 30 % ."
WHAT INSTRUMENT AND WHAT INCENTIVE PROGRAM BE TO BE USE TO DO THIS ?
MR EK MENTION SOME SPECIFIC AREA .
DESC-RE BE DESC-GREAT DEAL WORK TO BE DO ON THIS PROGRAM .
"MADAM PRESIDENT , X-I THINK MR BARROSO DESC-REALLY DO HAVE , TODAY , MOST DESC-DIFFICULT ROLE ."
X-IT BE ONE MOST DESC-DIFFICULT JOB IN EUROPEAN UNION THAT X-HE HAVE TO DO .
MR BARROSO HAVE TO MANEUVER DESC-ARTFULLY BETWEEN SE PROPOSITION .
"X-I THINK DESC-BEST SE BE 2020 STRATEGY , WHICH HAVE BE PROPOSE BY COMMISSION ."
"DESC-RE BE MINISTRY DESC-INTERNAL TRADE , BUT DESC-RE BE NO DESC-INTERNAL TRADE ."
"X-I BE DESC-NOT , COURSE , DESC-FREE MARKET DESC-FANATIC ."

X-WE HAVE PROVIDE NO CLARIFICATION WITH REGARD TO FUTURE DEVELOPMENT EUROPEAN UNION .
"THIS HAVE , COURSE , GIVE RISE TO DESC-MUCH DISCORD THAT X-WE CAN DESC-NOW SENSE ."
"DESC-ORWISE , X-WE WILL BE HEAD FOR DISASTER WITH X-WE EYE DESC-WIDE DESC-OPEN !"
X-I FEEL X-HE WOULD HAVE LEARN DESC-SO DESC-MUCH FROM X-I THIS EVENING !
"WHENEVER PEOPLE EUROPE GET CHANCE REFERENDUM , X-Y REJECT X-IT ."
EU BE DESC-ALREADY CRUMBLE .
"DESC-HOWEVER , X-I HAVE COUPLE QUESTION IN THIS REGARD THAT GIVE X-I CAUSE FOR CONCERN ."
WILL DESC-PROCLAIMED DESC-NEW STRATEGY SUFFER DESC-SIMILAR FATE TO X-ITS PREDECESSOR ?
"SOVEREIGNTY DESC-ALSO MEAN TAKE RESPONSIBILITY , AND DESC-CONSEQUENTLY TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DESC-WRONG FINANCE POLICY ."
"X-WE MUST SHOW SOLIDARITY , COURSE , BUT X-IT MUST DESC-NOT BE ONE WAY STREET ."
CENTRALISTIC DESC-ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE FROM BRUSSELS DICTATING EUROPEAN STANDARD WOULD DESC-SURELY BE DESC-WRONG WAY TO GO .
THAT BE DESC-RAR DESC-LOW LEVEL FROM X-HE .
LET X-WE STICK TO ALL THING X-WE CAN DO DESC-TOGER AT EUROPEAN LEVEL .
THAT BE DESC-BEST EUROPEAN DESC-GOOD GOVERNANCE X-WE CAN HAVE .
THIS BE DESC-ALSO DESC-EVIDENT IN PROPOSAL THAT X-WE DESC-SOCIAL DEMOCRAT BE DESC-RESPONSIBLE FOR .
X-WE SEE SITUATION IN WORLD .

"THAT BE HOW X-WE GO ON , THROW BALL INTO EACH DESC-OR X-POSS COURT IN THAT WAY ."
"DESC-RE BE WINNER IN THIS KIND POLICY , BUT DESC-RE BE DESC-ALSO DESC-MANY LOSER ."
THAT BE SOMETHING X-WE NEED TO HAVE COURAGE TO CHANGE IN THIS EUROPE .
COMMISSION BE DESC-YET TO PROVIDE ANSWER IN THIS REGARD .
X-WE NEED TO GIVE DESC-SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO WHAT 23 MILLION DESC-UNEMPLOYED EUROPEAN CITIZEN WILL DO IN FUTURE .
"DESC-SECONDLY , X-WE SHOULD ENSURE THAT X-WE HAVE SPECIFIC TARGET FOR COMBATE POVERTY ."
SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT X-Y DO DESC-NOT LIKE DEFINITION .
TO SE PEOPLE X-I WOULD SAY THAT X-Y SHOULD DESC-NOT LET TECHNICALITY STAND IN WAY .
DESC-OR BE SAY THAT X-WE DO DESC-NOT HAVE DESC-LEGAL BASIS IN TREATY .
TO SE PEOPLE X-I WOULD SAY THAT X-WE HAVE DESC-NEW TREATY LISBON .
"DESC-THIRDLY , X-WE MUST WORK IN DESC-CONSISTENT MANNER ON DESC-BINDING EMPLOYMENT PLAN ."
X-WE NEED TO LINK DESC-GREEN INVESTMENT TO DESC-NEW JOB .
X-WE NEED TO RE EDUCATE AND TRAIN X-WE WORKFORCE TO BE DESC-ABLE TO TAKE DESC-UP SE JOB .
"EU 2020 DO DESC-NOT DESC-YET DELIVER ON SE PARAMETER , DESC-SO X-WE DESC-STILL HAVE WORK TO DO ."
"X-IT BE DESC-FAR MORE DESC-IMPORTANT THAN THAT , COLLEAGUE ."
X-YOU WILL RECEIVE THAT NEXT WEEK IN CONJUNCTION WITH PROFESSOR MONTUS X-POSS REPORT .

X-IT BE DESC-HARDLY MENTION IN THIS DOCUMENT .
"X-IT BE , DESC-REFORE , TIME TO EVALUATE AND ADMIT CONSEQUENCE POLICY THAT HAVE BE FOLLOW ."
X-IT BE TIME TO PRIORITISE DESC-SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY .
X-IT BE TIME TO PUT STOP TO DESC-FINANCIAL SPECULATION AND DOMINATION ECONOMY BY FINANCE .
DESC-MANY MISTAKE AND ONE DEFENDANT IN DOCK EURO .
X-WE DESC-HERE BE BIT DESC-TIRED HEAR ONE OFF EXCUSE SUBPRIME CRISIS BE DESC-ALSO ONE OFF .
"DESC-HOWEVER , X-WE CAN DESC-NOT BLAME WORKER , SMALLHOLDER OR ENTREPRENEUR FOR THIS SITUATION ."
THAT BE DESC-TRUE .
X-WE DESC-REFORE DESC-ALSO NEED STRATEGY FOR ACTION .
X-IT BE MORE LIKE REFLECTION PUT TO PAPER THAT BE DESC-NOW BE STEAMROLLER THROUGH IN DESC-FAST TRACK PROCEDURE .
WHER THIS BE WAY TO AVOID PROBLEM THAT MR BARROSO HAVE DESC-QUITE DESC-RIGHTLY DESCRIBE BE DESC-DOUBTFUL .
THAT BE DESC-PRECISELY WHAT HAPPEN .
"THAT BE DESC-NOT CRITICISM , EIR ."
"THIS WOULD DESC-NOT SURPRISE X-I , BECAUSE X-WE CAN DESC-NOT ACHIEVE CHANGE IN THIS WAY ."
STANDARD CAN DESC-NOT BE CRISIS !
STANDARD MUST BE DESC-FORWARD LOOK PERSPECTIVE .
"DESC-HOWEVER , X-WE WILL DESC-NOT DESC-ACTUALLY DO X-IT , COURSE ."
THIS BE AIM EUROPE 2020 STRATEGY .
IN 10 YEARSTIME WILL X-WE BE MORE OR DESC-LESS UNITE ?
WILL X-WE BE MORE DESC-SUPPORTIVE ?
"WHAT EUROPE NEED TODAY BE TO BE UNITE AND TO TAKE DESC-FORCEFUL ACTION , DESC-NOT DESC-FURR DIVISION ."
"DESC-REFORE , COMMISSIONER , X-IT BE MOST DESC-DISAPPOINTING THAT 11 COUNTRY WILL DESC-NOT BE DESC-PRESENT ON FRIDAY ."
COURSE SUPERVISION DESC-FINANCIAL MARKET NEED TO BE INCREASE AND COURSE X-WE NEED DESC-TOUGHER LEGISLATION .
"WHEN X-I HEAR MR BLOOM , X-I BE DESC-REALLY UPSET ."
X-I THINK MR BLOOM SHOULD APOLOGISE TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT X-HE HAVE INSULT .
"NL MR PRESIDENT , X-I CHALLENGE COMMISSION AND COUNCIL TO MAKE DESC-CLEAR CHOICE ."
DESC-FIRST ALL CHOOSE DEMOCRACY .
DESC-SECONDLY WORK HAVE TO BE PAY WORK .
"OBJECTIVE 75 % EMPLOYMENT SOUND FINE , BUT EUROPE DO DESC-NOT NEED ANY MORE DESC-POOR WORKER ."
HOW DO COUNCIL DESC-ACTUALLY DEFINE EMPLOYMENT ?
DESC-THIRDLY CHOOSE SOUND PUBLIC SPENDING .
DESC-FOURTHLY CHOOSE DESC-SOCIAL DESC-INTERNAL MARKET .
DESC-FIFTHLY CHOOSE POVERTY REDUCTION .
"AS DESC-FAR AS POVERTY REDUCTION BE CONCERN , COUNCIL BE AIM DESC-ONLY AT DESC-ECONOMIC GROWTH ."
"X-I SEE NO DESC-OR WAY TO PROTECT X-WE JOB , X-WE DESC-SOCIAL SYSTEM ."
"WHAT X-WE NEED BE PRAGMATISM , COURAGE AND DECENTRALISATION ."
"RO DESC-SUSTAINABLE DESC-ECONOMIC GROWTH REQUIRE DESC-HUGE , DESC-STEADY INVESTMENT IN TRANSPORT SECTOR AS DESC-WELL ."
DESC-WELL COORDINATE DEVELOPMENT TRANSPORT SECTOR BE DESC-CRUCIAL TO DESC-SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND TO RETAIN AND CREATE DESC-STABLE JOB .
"EL MR PRESIDENT , THANK X-YOU DESC-VERY DESC-MUCH ."
APPLAUSE
"RO DURING DESC-LAST TWO YEAR , X-WE HAVE FACE MOST DESC-SEVERE DESC-GLOBAL DESC-ECONOMIC CRISIS ."
STRATEGY X-POSS OBJECTIVE MUST BE DESC-REALISTIC .
C EUROPEAN UNION REPRESENT DESC-LARGEST GEOPOLITICAL ENTITY IN WORLD IN TERM POPULATION .
IN THIS CONTEXT X-I CONSIDER X-IT KEY TO RETAIN DESC-STRATEGIC FOCUS DESC-PARTICULARLY ON DESC-ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB .
BE THIS EUROPE X-WE WANT FOR 2020 ?
FIGHTBACK BY GREEK WORK CLASS SHOULD BE SUPPORT BY WORKER ALL OVER EUROPE .
X-WE HAVE TO BREAK DICTATORSHIP MARKET .
"X-Y DESC-EVEN BEGIN BY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DESC-PREVIOUS STRATEGY BE DESC-NOT , FOR DESC-VARIOUS REASON , DESC-SUCCESSFUL ."
X-Y DESC-N SET OUT DESC-BOLD OBJECTIVE AND TRY TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT EVERYTHING DESC-REALLY WILL BE DESC-BETTER THIS TIME .
"X-IT BE DESC-NOT DESC-BETTER , DESC-HOWEVER ."
"STRATEGY COME AND GO , AND ECONOMY COLLAPSE ."
THOSE STRATEGY FAIL TO RESPECT DESC-BASIC RULE DESC-ECONOMIC LIFE .
WHY BE THIS ?
EUROPE 2020 BE DESC-NOT X-WE GOAL .
EUROPE 2020 MUST BE INSTRUMENT TO ENABLE X-WE TO ACHIEVE X-WE GOAL .
"EUROPE 2020 MUST SET IN MOTION SPECIFIC PROJECT FOR GROWTH , EMPLOYMENT , RESEARCH , INNOVATION AND DESC-SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVENESS ."
X-WE SHOULD GIVE X-WE DESC-FULL SUPPORT TO MR REHN X-POSS MEASURE .
"THAT BE WHAT X-WE NEED , NO MORE AND NO DESC-LESS ."
AND X-WE BE DESC-STILL IN DESC-SAME POSITION .
X-I DESC-ALSO FAIL TO SEE DESC-TANGIBLE DESIRE TO IDENTIFY PRIORITY .
EUROPE X-POSS PROBLEM BE X-ITS LEVEL COMPETITIVENESS IN DESC-GLOBAL SYSTEM .
"DESC-REFORE , X-IT CAN DESC-NOT DISREGARD DESC-SOCIAL COHESION , ONE DESC-FUNDAMENTAL FACTOR COMPETITIVENESS ."
THIS BE DESC-SO THAT X-WE DO DESC-NOT FIND X-OURSELVES IN ANY SITUATION EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCE .
X-I BE DESC-REFORE DESC-VERY DESC-PLEASED THAT ME EU 2020 STRATEGY BE DESC-NOW SUSTAINABILITY .
DISADVANTAGE SUSTAINABILITY BE THAT X-IT BE DESC-VERY DESC-GENERAL CONCEPT THAT CAN DESC-ALSO LACK SUBSTANCE .
X-WE DESC-REFORE NEED TO MAKE X-IT MORE SPECIFIC .
THAT HAVE BE DESC-COMPLETELY LOSE .

DESC-ORDINARY EU CITIZEN WHO DO DESC-NOT DESC-DIRECTLY USE AVIATION SERVICE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS BUSINESS .
X-IT BE DESC-REFORE DESC-TOTALLY DESC-INAPPROPRIATE TO TRANSFER DESC-SUCH AVIATION LOSS TO EU MEMBER STATE .
X-Y WILL DESC-NOT GET DESC-NEW HOUSE OR DESC-BETTER ACCOMMODATION FROM ANY AIRLINE COMPANY OR EU GOVERNMENT .
"WHY SHOULD X-Y , DESC-REFORE , CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS MAKE DESC-UP FOR LOSE PROFIT AIRLINE COMPANY ?"
THAT WOULD DESC-SURELY BE DESC-ABSURD .
DESC-ONLY DESC-FAIRLY SPECIFIC INFORMATION COME FROM STATEMENT ABOUT CLOSURE MORE AREA AIR SPACE .
"X-I THINK THAT MEASURE DESC-CURRENTLY PROPOSE BY COMMISSION BE , DESC-UNFORTUNATELY , DESC-NOT DESC-SUFFICIENT ."
"DESC-MOREOVER , MR SIMPSON X-POSS ABSENCE FROM THIS EVENING X-POSS DEBATE SAY DESC-FAR MORE THAN X-HE PRESENCE ."
X-I RAISE THIS BECAUSE X-IT BE DESC-TYPICAL DESC-MANY JOURNEY UNDERTAKE BY DESC-IRISH PEOPLE IN DESC-RECENT WEEK .
EU TRANSPORT MINISTER HAVE ESTABLISH THREE DESC-SEPARATE FLY ZONE BASE ON SAFETY RISK TO AIRCRAFT .
"THIS BE DESC-WELCOME DEVELOPMENT AND , COURSE , DESC-FURR MEASURE BE DESC-STILL NEED ."
X-I DESC-STRONGLY SUPPORT EFFORT TO DESC-FAST TRACK INTRODUCTION DESC-SINGLE EUROPEAN SKY CONCEPT .
"X-I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT COMMISSIONER , WHO BE WITH X-WE THIS EVENING , WILL SPEARHEAD THIS ."
ROLE EUROCONTROL MUST DESC-ALSO BE DESC-CLOSELY EXAMINE .
X-IT MUST BE GIVE DESC-STATUTORY POWER AS OPPOSE TO COORDINATE ROLE WHICH X-IT DESC-CURRENTLY HOLD .
ROLE EUROPEAN UNION MUST BE STRENGN IN AFTERMATH THIS CRISIS .
"IF DESC-RE BE ONE THING THAT TOURISM NEED , X-IT BE CERTAINTY ."
"THIS BE , COURSE , DESC-SIGNIFICANT LOSS ."
X-I MUST ASK X-YOU TO CONTINUE WORK TO THIS END .
X-I MUST DESC-ALSO ASK X-YOU TO CONTINUE WORK FOR PASSENGER INFORMATION AND PASSENGER RIGHTS .
X-I MUST ASK X-YOU TO CONTINUE WORK TO THIS END .
"BY DO DESC-SO , X-IT UNDERLINE DESC-ONCE DESC-AGAIN IMPORTANCE DESC-PREVENTATIVE APPROACH TO SE PHENOMENON ."
"DESC-THUS , X-IT BE DESC-NOT DESC-JUST EUROPEAN PROBLEM , BUT PROBLEM FOR DESC-INTERNATIONAL AVIATION ."
EVERYONE CAN REMOVE RISK BY DESC-SIMPLY DESC-NOT FLY .
"OBJECTIFICATION DESC-ENTIRE ISSUE MUST BE AT HEART THING , DESC-HOWEVER ."
AND DESC-CERTAINLY EVIDENCE BE DESC-RE FOR ALL TO SEE .
"E X-I BE DESC-NOT DESC-ONLY ONE , MADAM PRESIDENT , BUT THANK X-YOU ."
COULD COMMISSIONER TELL X-WE WHER X-IT BE USE OR WHER THIS BE BE CONSIDER ?
X-I DESC-ONLY HAVE THREE MINUTE AT BEGIN .
X-IT BE DESC-CLEAR THAT VOLCANO CONTINUE TO ERUPT AS THIS DESC-ICELANDIC VOLCANO BE DO .
"THIS BE PART THIS BUSINESS , X-WE MUST BE DESC-VERY DESC-CLEAR ABOUT THAT ."
"NOBODY DESC-ALONE CAN BE DESC-RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS RISK NO AIRLINE , NO GOVERNMENT , NO EUROPEAN UNION ."
"X-IT HAVE BE DESC-INTERGOVERNMENTAL BODY THAT HAVE BE DEAL WITH THIS DESC-SO DESC-FAR , AS DESC-WELL AS DESC-NATIONAL AUTHORITY ."
"TO EXCLUDE , PREVENT OR FORESEE EVERYTHING WHICH CAN HAPPEN IN AVIATION BE DESC-IMPOSSIBLE ."
THIS WILL BE DESC-VERY COMPLICATE THING .
SAFETY PLANE AND LIFE MUST COME DESC-FIRST .
"DESC-RE BE RESPONSIBILITY , WHICH DESC-MAINLY REST WITH PILOT ."
"IN EUROPE TODAY , PILOT TEND TO REJECT THIS KIND DESC-NEW RESPONSIBILITY ."
THIS BE DESC-VERY DESC-CLEAR MESSAGE .
"IN DESC-GENERAL , PASSENGER RIGHTS LEGISLATION HAVE WORK DESC-VERY DESC-WELL AND LOGIC MUST BE DESC-RE ."
THIS BE DESC-DIFFERENT WORD .
SOMEBODY MENTION THAT X-Y SHOULD HAVE INSURANCE .
X-I ASK X-Y AS DESC-WELL ABOUT INSURANCE .
X-Y HAVE CONTINGENCY PLAN ON HOW TO DEAL WITH DESC-EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH DISRUPT SCHEDULE .
"REGARD ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORT , X-WE WILL , COURSE , PUSH DESC-AHEAD ."
ONE X-WE DESC-BIGGEST PRIORITY FOR NEAR FUTURE WILL BE TO HAVE DESC-BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT ALL SE POSSIBILITY .
THIS BE ANOR DESC-INTERESTING STORY .
"X-I MUST STRESS THAT VOLCANO DO DESC-NOT OBEY ANY RULE , AND X-WE CAN DESC-NOT EXCLUDE DESC-POSSIBLE DESC-EXTRAORDINARY EVENT ."
DEBATE BE DESC-CLOSE .
WRITE STATEMENT RULE 149
X-WE DO DESC-NOT HAVE REPORT ON DAMAGE TO AIR TRANSPORT .
KULL HAVE DESC-LITERALLY WORK HAVOC WITH AIR TRANSPORT IN EUROPEAN UNION .
X-WE HAVE NO REPORT DESC-OR FORM TRANSPORT BE USE TO BRING PEOPLE HOME .
X-MY DESC-OR QUESTION WOULD DESC-MERELY REPEAT QUESTION BRIAN SIMPSON .
"EVERY DAY , 12 PEOPLE DIE BECAUSE SHORTAGE ORGAN DESC-AVAILABLE FOR TRANSPLANTATION ."
"IN POLAND , FIGURE BE IN POLAND , X-I HAVE DISTRIBUTE BADGE AND BRACELET WHICH ENCOURAGE SUPPORT TRANSPLANTATION MEDICINE ."
PROMOTE IDEA TRANSPLANTATION AND COORDINATE EXCHANGE EXPERIENCE BETWEEN MEMBER STATE CAN SAVE THOUSAND LIFE .
THIS WOULD DESC-ALSO BE DESC-SIGNIFICANT TOOL IN FIGHT AGAINST ORGAN TRAFFICKING AND DESC-HUMAN TRAFFICKING .

X-WE PROPOSAL BE BASE ON TWO PRINCIPLE .
X-WE PROPOSAL BE MAKE THREE BUILDING BLOCK .
"DESC-FIRST , X-WE MUST REINFORCE BOTH PREVENTIVE AND DESC-CORRECTIVE ARM STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT ."
X-WE HAVE NEIR INTENTION NOR RESOURCE FOR THAT .
"SOME HAVE CRITICISE THIS , SAY THAT THIS BE BREACH DESC-PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY ."
WHY BE THIS DESC-IMPORTANT ?
X-WE SHOULD PREVENT AND TACKLE EMERGE PROBLEM BEFORE X-Y ESCALATE INTO CRISIS .
"SE INDICATOR COULD INCLUDE , FOR INSTANCE , PRODUCTIVITY TREND , UNIT LABOR COST AND DESC-CURRENT ACCOUNT DEVELOPMENT ."
"DESC-INSTEAD , X-IT AIM AT REBALANCE DESC-ECONOMIC GROWTH IN EUROPE AS WHOLE ."

EURO WILL DESC-ONLY BE DESC-VIABLE IF X-WE DESC-COLLECTIVELY GIVE X-OURSELVES RESOURCE TO MAKE X-IT DESC-SO .
X-WE MUST LOOK BEYOND DESC-NATIONAL CONSIDERATION AND TOWARDS EUROPEAN CONSIDERATION .
X-MY GROUP BE ASK EUROPE TO WAKE DESC-UP .
DESC-FINANCIALLY REWARD ONE THAT DESC-CLEAN DESC-UP X-Y PUBLIC FINANCES AND PUNISH ONE THAT REFUSE TO DO DESC-SO !

SAIL SHIP THROUGH STORM BE DESC-NOT DESC-EASY .
X-I HAVE MESSAGE FOR EACH X-YOU .

THIS REGULATION MARK STEP DESC-FORWARD IN TERM MAKE RAIL FREIGHT TRANSPORT MORE DESC-EFFICIENT .

"COURSE , DESC-PRESENT REGULATION BE DESC-JUST ONE MEAN TO IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS RAIL FREIGHT TRANSPORT ."
DESC-OR DESC-NECESSARY MEASURE INCLUDE OPTIMISE OPERATION MARKET AND PROMOTE INTERMODAL TRANSPORT .
X-IT BE DESC-NOT DUPLICATION WHAT DESC-NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGER BE DESC-ALREADY DO TODAY .
"ON CONTRARY , X-IT COMPLEMENT X-Y WORK AND ENSURE DESC-BETTER COORDINATION ."
"DESC-HOWEVER , DESC-CLEAR PRIORITISATION CRITERION DO NEED TO BE ESTABLISH TO OPTIMISE DEPLOYMENT FREIGHT AND PASSENGER TRANSPORT ."
THIS BE DESC-VERY DESC-IMPORTANT .
"X-I COME FROM GERMANY , WHERE X-IT WOULD BE DESC-TERRIBLE IF FREIGHT TRANSPORT TAKE PRIORITY OVER PASSENGER TRANSPORT ."
THAT WOULD HAVE DESC-VERY DESC-NEGATIVE EFFECT ON DESC-LOCAL PUBLIC PASSENGER TRANSPORT .
"AT DESC-SAME TIME , X-WE BE DESC-VERY DESC-WELL DESC-AWARE THAT X-WE NEED DESC-CONTINUOUS SYSTEM IN EUROPE ."
THIS BE SOMETHING THAT X-WE WANT AS DESC-WELL AS NEED .
DESC-RE BE DESC-COMPLETELY DESC-DIFFERENT OPINION ON THIS .

"DESC-ORWISE , X-WE ALL AGREE THAT X-WE NEED THIS FREIGHT TRANSPORT IN EUROPE ."
X-IT BE DESC-OBVIOUS THAT THIS MIGHT REDUCE COMPETITIVENESS RAIL TRANSPORT .
"E MADAM PRESIDENT , X-WE HAVE DESC-JUST RETURN FROM TEN T DAY HOLD IN ZARAGOZA DESC-RECENTLY ."
THAT BE WHY THIS ISSUE BE DESC-SO DESC-IMPORTANT .
DEUTSCHE BAHN BE PROTECT .
USE SLEDGEHAMMER TO DESC-SMOOTH WAY FOR EUROPEAN NETWORK MANAGEMENT WILL DESC-NOT SOLVE EXIST PROBLEM .
"ON CONTRARY , CENTRALISE AND FRAGMENT RESPONSIBILITY WILL GENERATE DESC-NEW PROBLEM ."
"DESC-REFORE , PROPOSE COMPROMISE THAT BE ON TABLE SHOULD , IN X-MY OPINION , BE REJECT ."
X-I WOULD DESC-SIMPLY LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT X-WE HAVE DESC-DIFFERENT SYSTEM AND RAIL NETWORK IN MEMBER STATE .
"DESC-THUS , THIS WILL DESC-NATURALLY DESC-ALWAYS BE DESC-VERY DESC-DIFFICULT IN DESC-DENSELY POPULATE REGION ."
"DESC-HOWEVER , X-WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT PASSENGER TRANSPORT DESC-ALSO REMAIN DESC-ATTRACTIVE OPTION IN DESC-DENSELY POPULATE REGION ."

WHAT SURPRISE X-I ABOUT THIS DRAFT BE FACT THAT X-IT MAKE NO MENTION BRENNER BASE TUNNEL .
BRENNER BASE TUNNEL MUST DESC-NOT BECOME DESC-BLACK HOLE FOR BILLION EURO .
X-I EXPECT DESC-CLEAR INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CONSTRUCTION PROJECT .
X-I THINK THIS TEXT HAVE POTENTIAL TO CULMINATE IN DESC-AMBITIOUS EUROPEAN PROJECT .
X-I DO DESC-NOT THINK THIS REGULATION WILL HAVE ANY DESC-NEGATIVE IMPACT ON PASSENGER RAIL TRANSPORT .
AND X-WE DESC-ALSO KNOW THAT X-Y IMPLEMENTATION HAVE TO BE COORDINATE AND DESC-COHERENT AT EUROPEAN LEVEL .

"X-I AGREE THAT DESC-NEW DEFINITION BE NEED , BUT X-WE SHOULD DESC-NOT LIMIT X-OURSELVES TO DEFINITION AND LABEL ."
X-I HOPE AND TRUST THAT THIS WILL BE CASE .
EFFECT NANOMATERIAL ON DESC-HUMAN BODY BE UNKNOWN .

X-WE REPRESENT CITIZEN AND X-WE MUST DESC-NOT FORGET THIS FACT .
MOST X-WE WOULD DESC-ALSO AGREE THAT QUESTION TRANSPARENCY BE DESC-CRUCIAL WHEN X-WE ADDRESS THIS DOSSIER .
X-WE DESC-REFORE NEED TO GUARANTEE PUBLIC ACCESS TO DATUM ON WHICH RISK ASSESSMENT FOR NOVEL FOOD BE BASE .

"X-IT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE EU LEGISLATION IN THIS AREA , BUT DESC-RE BE DESC-MANY DESC-DIFFERENT INTEREST INVOLVE ."
WHO DESC-ACTUALLY WANT SE DESC-NEW INITIATIVE ?
BE X-IT INDUSTRY THAT WANT TO SELL MORE PRODUCT ?
OR BE X-IT DESC-REALLY CONSUMER ?
X-I DO DESC-NOT BELIEVE X-IT BE DESC-LATTER .
"IN EUROPE , X-WE CAN DESC-EASILY FEED X-OURSELVES WITHOUT NEED FOR CLONE PRODUCT ."
DESC-PRECISE PURPOSE SE REGULATION BE TO SAFEGUARD FOOD SAFETY AND DESC-HUMAN HEALTH .
"DESC-UNFORTUNATELY , DESC-HOWEVER , REALITY BE DESC-MUCH DULLER ."

DESC-RE BE DESC-MAJOR DOUBT AT MOMENT SURROUND SAFETY MEAT DERIVE FROM CLONE ANIMAL .

THIS TECHNIQUE BE DESC-STILL DESC-TOO DESC-DANGEROUS TO BE USE FOR DESC-DIRECT BENEFIT MANKIND .
X-IT BE DESC-SERIOUS DESC-ETHICAL ISSUE .
X-WE MUST GUARANTEE THAT X-IT BE DESC-SAFE .
"DESC-FIRSTLY , LEGISLATION MUST HAVE DESC-SCIENTIFIC BASIS ."
"X-WE DECISION MUST BE BASE ON DESC-RELEVANT RESEARCH , AND ON OBJECTIVE AND DESC-WELL CONDUCT SCIENCE ."
"X-IT MUST DESC-NOT BE QUESTION DESC-PERSONAL TASTE , DESC-RELIGIOUS CONVICTION OR DESC-PARTICULAR INTEREST ."
CONSUMER WILL REJECT NOVEL FOOD IF X-Y CAN DESC-NOT BE DESC-CERTAIN THAT WHAT X-WE BE OFFER BE DESC-INDEED DESC-SAFE .
CITIZEN EUROPE HAVE DESC-RIGHT TO DEMAND THAT .
THIS BE AT DESC-COMPLETE ODDS WITH INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT .
"X-WE MUST DESC-NOT IMPEDE OR PREVENT DESC-NEW THING , BUT X-WE MUST GUARANTEE THAT X-Y BE DESC-SAFE ."
SITUATION IN EUROPEAN UNION REGARD X-WE MEAT SUPPLY BE DESC-ADEQUATE .
"DESC-RE BE NO REASON , DESC-REFORE , TO HAVE TO FALL DESC-BACK ON MEAT FROM CLONE ANIMAL ."
MEAT FROM CLONE ANIMAL BE DESC-DEFINITELY DESC-NOT DESC-PRIOR X-I DESC-HARMFUL .

DESC-RE BE NO DESC-RELIABLE EVIDENCE DESC-AVAILABLE TO SHOW WHAT KIND SUFFER DESC-SUCH ANIMAL ENDURE .
CLONING BE DESC-CLEAR ENCROACHMENT ON NATURE AND X-WE REQUIRE DESC-CLEAR DESC-POLITICAL DECISION ON THIS .
DESC-NOT EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE MAKE BE DESC-ALSO FOR MANKIND X-POSS BENEFIT .
DESC-RE MUST BE NO CLONE ANIMAL IN FOOD CHAIN .
"X-WE MUST SEND OUT DESC-CONSISTENT , DESC-CLEAR DESC-POLITICAL MESSAGE TO COMMISSION AND X-WE CITIZEN ."

X-WE DO DESC-NOT NEED MEAT FROM CLONE ANIMAL FOR SAKE FOOD SUPPLY SECURITY .
"AS EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT X-WE SHOULD , DURING DESC-FORTHCOMING DESC-SECOND READING , ."
PRESIDENT CUT OFF SPEAKER
X-WE NEED DESC-NEW REGULATION IN ORDER TO PLACE NOVEL FOOD ON MARKET DESC-SAFELY .
X-WE DESC-CERTAINLY DO DESC-NOT NEED MEAT FROM CLONE ANIMAL .
DESC-RE BE WHOLE RANGE REASON WHY X-WE DO DESC-NOT NEED THIS MEAT FROM CLONE ANIMAL .
"X-WE EUROPEAN CITIZEN , WHO BE X-WE CONSUMER , REJECT THIS PRODUCT ."
"THIS BE DESC-PRESENT , ON ONE HAND , AS SCAREMONGERING AND , ON DESC-OR , AS ANT X-I DESC-SCIENTIFIC ."

"PRODUCT MUST BE DESC-SAFE , TEST AND APPROVE AND LABEL IN WAY THAT DO DESC-NOT MISLEAD CONSUMER ."
PRESIDENT CUT OFF SPEAKER
ONE ASK ONESELF WHY SHOULD X-WE ?
BE DESC-RE DESC-PERHAPS SHORTAGE MEAT STOCK IN EUROPE ?
DESC-ABSOLUTELY DESC-NOT .
THIS BE DESC-NOT DESC-VALID ARGUMENT .
BE DESC-RE DESC-ENOUGH INFORMATION FOR CONSUMER ?
CAN CONSUMER DESC-CLEARLY UNDERSTAND AND CHOOSE WHICH BE MEAT FROM CLONE ANIMAL AND WHICH BE DESC-NOT ?
"BE X-Y , BY ANY CHANCE , DESC-SAFE FROM DESC-SCIENTIFIC POINT VIEW ?"
"DESC-WELL , X-WE WILL BE DESC-ABLE TO SAY IN 50 YEAR ."
X-IT TAKE CENTURY TO WORK OUT THAT PENICILLIN COULD COME FROM MOULD .
"DO EUROPE , PERCHANCE , SAY DESC-YES TO EVERYTHING ?"
"NO , BECAUSE THIS EUROPE DO DESC-NOT WANT PRODUCT PROVENANCE STATE , X-IT BE AGAINST ."
PRESIDENT CUT OFF SPEAKER
"DESC-FIRST , REPLACEMENT DESC-DECENTRALISED AUTHORISATION PROCEDURE WITH DESC-CENTRALISED PROCEDURE AT EU LEVEL ."
SAFETY ASSESSMENT WOULD BE CARRY OUT BY EFSA AND AUTHORISATION DECISION TAKE BY COMMISSION .
"DESC-FIFTH , CLARIFICATION FACT THAT ALL FOOD PRODUCT CONTAIN NANOMATERIAL REQUIRE CASE BY CASE AUTHORISATION BY EU CITIZEN ."
X-I LOOK DESC-FORWARD TO DEBATE WITH EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL ON THIS .
ANNEX POSITION COMMISSION

DESC-INDUSTRIAL EMISSION INTEGRATE POLLUTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL RECAST DEBATE
"MR PRESIDENT , THIS DEBATE BE TIME DESC-BADLY ."
X-I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASISE TWO ASPECT .
DESC-FIRST BE DESC-ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENT IN DESC-INDUSTRIAL PLANT .
WHAT X-WE BE TALK ABOUT DESC-HERE BE DESC-BETTER IMPLEMENTATION DESC-BEST DESC-AVAILABLE TECHNIQUE IN EUROPE .
X-I HAVE HEAR DESC-MANY ARGUMENT IN THIS DEBATE .
"X-I DO DESC-NOT LIKE TO REMEMBER X-MY PAST , BUT X-I COME FROM DESC-FORMER GDR , DESC-EAST GERMANY ."
"X-WE BE DESC-NOT TALK ABOUT THING WHICH BE DESC-NOT DESC-AVAILABLE ON CONTRARY , THIS BE DESC-UP TO DATE TECHNOLOGY ."
THIS DIRECTIVE REPRESENT DESC-SIGNIFICANT STEP DESC-FORWARD IN CONTROL DESC-INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION IN EUROPEAN UNION .
X-IT DESC-ALSO PROVIDE X-WE WITH OPPORTUNITY TO STIMULATE ECO INNOVATION .
"MR PRESIDENT , X-I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANK MR KRAHMER FOR HAVE PUSH FOR DESC-AMBITIOUS LEGISLATION ."
X-IT BE DESC-REFORE WORTH VOTE FOR .
X-I BE DESC-PLEASED THAT X-WE SUCCEED IN ACHIEVE THIS .
THIS PLACE GERMANY AT DESC-COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE COMPARE TO DESC-OR .
THIS BE ARGUMENT THAT CAN APPLY TO DESC-MANY ASPECT DESC-ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION .
DESC-RE HAVE TO BE LEVEL PLAY FIELD .
QUESTION BE THAT X-WE HAVE DESC-NOW RECAST THIS LEGISLATION .
MEMBER STATE HAVE GET OFF HOOK .
"X-MY MEMBER STATE , UNITE KINGDOM , HAVE GET OFF HOOK ."
X-IT HAVE DESC-NOT DO WHAT GERMANY DO .
"MR PRESIDENT , X-I SHALL KEEP X-IT BRIEF , AS NERLAND URUGUAY MATCH BE DESC-STILL GO ON ."
"X-I SHALL KEEP X-IT BRIEF , DESC-N , AS X-I WANT TO CATCH END GAME ."
"IN LIGHT THIS , X-I BE DESC-TRULY DISAPPOINT WITH COURSE NEGOTIATION ."
"DESC-NEVERLESS , WHEN ALL BE SAY AND DO , X-I BE DESC-DEFINITE SUPPORTER THIS TIGHTEN DESC-UP ."
"AT END DAY , THAT BE WHAT THIS BE ALL ABOUT ."
X-WE BE TO BE GIVE LEVEL PLAY FIELD AND X-WE BE TO HAVE DESC-CLEAN AIR .
"AT END DAY , DESC-HOWEVER , X-WE BE MAKE PROGRESS ."
"X-I BELIEVE THAT MATCH BE DESC-NOW OVER , AND THAT NERLAND HAVE REACH DESC-FINAL ."
"DESC-SADLY , ENGLAND COULD DESC-NOT BE DESC-RE , BUT DESC-NEVER MIND X-WE CAN DESC-NOT HAVE EVERYTHING ."
"X-WE HAVE REACH , IN END , WHAT BE DESC-ACCEPTABLE COMPROMISE ."
MEMBER STATE BE DESC-NOT DESC-PARTICULARLY DESC-HAPPY .
DESC-CERTAINLY SOME MEMBER THIS HOUSE BE DESC-VERY DESC-UNHAPPY .
"X-I HOPE MR EICKHOUT X-POSS UNHAPPINESS BE MITIGATE DESC-LATER BUT , DESC-NEVERLESS , X-IT BE DESC-GOOD DESC-OVERALL RESULT ."
"AT END DAY , THAT BE DESC-ALWAYS CONSUMER ."
THIS BE DESC-ALSO APPROACH X-WE SUPPORT FOR CARBON DIOXIDE AND DESC-OR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION .
THIS COMMITMENT ENSURE THAT THIS VARY REALITY WILL BE OBSERVE .
THIS APPLY IN DESC-PARTICULAR TO DESC-TRANSITIONAL DESC-NATIONAL PLAN WHICH WILL APPLY TO DESC-LARGE POWER PLANT .
"DESC-UNFORTUNATELY , ELECTRICITY MARKET BE DESC-NOT DESC-YET DESC-SINGLE MARKET ."
X-IT WILL TAKE TIME TO ACHIEVE THAT OBJECTIVE .
"COMMISSIONER , X-YOU SAY X-IT X-YOURSELF ."
"AFTER ALL , DESC-PREVIOUS DIRECTIVE DATE FROM 1996 THAT BE , 14 YEAR DESC-AGO !"
"IF X-WE DO X-WE WORK ON TIME , DESC-N X-WE CAN DESC-ALSO CARRY OUT INNOVATION AND DESC-STILL PROTECT JOB ."
"DESC-THUS X-WE HAVE DESC-GREAT SUCCESS , THOUGH X-IT BE SPOIL DESC-SOMEWHAT BY DESC-LARGE COMBUSTION PLANT ."
"DESC-SMALL FRY BE ARREST , WHILE DESC-BIG FISH BE ALLOW TO GO DESC-FREE ."
WHAT HAPPEN DESC-SO DESC-OFTEN IN LIFE BE DESC-ALSO DESC-UNFORTUNATELY HAPPEN DESC-HERE WITH DESC-INDUSTRIAL PLANT .
C X-IT BE DESC-CLEARLY DESC-VERY DESC-IMPORTANT TO PRESS FOR REDUCTION IN EMISSION DESC-HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE BY INDUSTRY .
THIS PROCESS BE DESC-VERY DESC-IMPORTANT .
THIS BE DESC-LEAST X-WE MUST DO FOR SAKE DESC-HUMAN HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT .
"DESC-EVEN AFTER THIS DIRECTIVE , SITUATION WILL DESC-NOT DESC-REALLY BE DESC-GOOD DESC-ANYWHERE IN EUROPE ."
X-I BE DESC-ESPECIALLY DESC-SORRY THAT BOTH NUMBER AND SIZE EXEMPTION BE DESC-SO DESC-GREAT UNDER THIS COMPROMISE .
"COURSE , X-IT BE DESC-GOOD COMPROMISE ."
AROUND 95 % POLISH ENERGY SECTOR BE BASE ON COAL .
ADOPTION KRAHMER REPORT WILL PUT ENTERPRISE IN DESC-DIFFICULT SITUATION .
THIS BE DESC-ECONOMICALLY AND DESC-TECHNICALLY DESC-PROBLEMATIC .
THIS SHOULD BE MAKE TO APPLY DESC-ONLY TO DESC-NEW INVESTMENT .
X-IT BE BASE ON DESC-DOGMATIC PRINCIPLE .
X-IT LEAD TO DESC-UNSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND DESC-UNFAIR COMPETITION WITHIN EUROPEAN UNION .
"DESC-FIRST , DEGREE FLEXIBILITY BE MAINTAIN FOR BUSINESS AND FOR AUTHORITY DESC-RESPONSIBLE FOR GRANT EXEMPTION ."
INSTALLATION WHICH COME UNDER REMIT THIS DIRECTIVE MUST BE AUTHORISE .
X-I THINK THAT THIS DIRECTIVE SHOULD BE LINK TO EUROPEAN UNION X-POSS DESC-INDUSTRIAL POLICY .
"PL MR PRESIDENT , X-I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON TWO MATTER ."
DESC-SECOND MATTER CONCERN MEMBER STATE WITH COAL BASE INDUSTRY AND DRAFT DIRECTIVE .
DESC-TRANSITIONAL PERIOD FOR DESC-LARGE COMBUSTION PLANT CONCERN DESC-SO2 AND NOX EMISSION BE DESC-PARTICULARLY DESC-IMPORTANT TO X-WE .
X-I WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE ALL NEGOTIATOR .
X-WE NEED CONTROL REDUCTION EXCESS BUREAUCRACY DESC-SO THAT X-WE CAN HAVE MORE DESC-EFFICIENT ACTIVITY .
X-WE NEED CONCRETE AND DESC-COMPACT GUIDELINE WHICH ESTABLISH EU DESC-WIDE MINIMUM STANDARD .
X-WE NEED ACCOMPANY INCREASE IN EFFICIENCY IN ORDER TO BE DESC-ABLE TO PROTECT X-WE ENVIRONMENT MORE DESC-EFFECTIVELY .
"DESC-HOWEVER , X-WE DESC-ALSO NEED DESC-INDEPENDENT AND OBJECTIVE CONTROL BODY WHICH WILL ENSURE ADHERENCE TO DESC-NEW GUIDELINE ."
DESC-AGRICULTURAL SECTOR DESC-REFORE HAVE LEAD ROLE TO PLAY IN CLIMATE AND DESC-ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION .
INDUSTRY CAN DESC-NOW FOLLOW .
RO X-I APPROVE COMPROMISE TEXT RESULT FROM TRIALOGUE .
DISPARITY BETWEEN MEMBER STATE IN TERM ENFORCE LEGISLATION AND MONITORING THIS ENFORCEMENT HAVE BE REMOVE .
X-IT WILL ALLOW DEROGATION TO BE AGREE FROM EMISSION VALUE ACCEPT AND BASE ON DESC-BEST DESC-AVAILABLE TECHNIQUE .
SE DEROGATION CONCERN CASE WHERE INVESTMENT COST OUTWEIGH DESC-ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT .
UPSHOT ALL THIS .
PRESIDENT CUT OFF SPEAKER
"X-IT BE PITY , BECAUSE X-IT BE DESC-HUGELY DESC-IMPORTANT DIRECTIVE FOR BOTH AIR QUALITY AND EU INDUSTRY ."
"ALTHOUGH X-WE ACHIEVE DESC-REASONABLE COMPROMISE , COMPANY MUST INVEST IN CLEANING TECHNOLOGY , WHICH BE DESC-NOT DESC-NECESSARILY DESC-AVAILABLE ."
PLANT WILL HAVE TO BE DESC-CLOSE DESC-PREMATURELY AND COST TO CONSUMER WILL BE DESC-CONSIDERABLE .
DESC-PREMATURE CLOSURE PLANT WOULD REPRESENT COST THAT RESULTANT DESC-ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT WOULD DESC-NOT COVER .
FLEXIBILITY BE DESC-STILL DESC-POSSIBLE BUT MUST DESC-NOW BE DESC-CLEARLY DESC-JUSTIFIED .
COMMISSION CAN COLLECT INFORMATION ON USE THIS FLEXIBILITY .
X-YOU BE DESC-PROBABLY DESC-AWARE THAT X-WE PROPOSAL BE FOR DESC-SHORTER TIME .
X-I HOPE THAT X-I HAVE DESC-ALREADY PROVE THAT IN DESC-FIRST HALF X-MY MANDATE .
X-I BELIEVE THAT LEVEL PLAY FIELD BE DESC-IMPORTANT ARGUMENT THAT X-WE HAVE TO FOLLOW .
X-I THINK X-IT BE DESC-FAIR TO SAY THAT X-WE GIVE INDUSTRY TIME TO BUILD CHANGE INTO DESC-NORMAL INVESTMENT PLAN .
X-WE SHOULD DESC-ALSO LOOK TO DESC-POSITIVE SIDE AGENDA THAT X-WE DESC-ALSO GAIN DESC-TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE .
THAT BE WHAT COMPROMISE BE BRING .
FACT BE THAT X-WE BE MOVE .
X-IT DESC-CERTAINLY HAVE SUPPORT COMMISSION .
"DESC-GOOD OMEN , X-I THINK ."
"WHO DESC-EXACTLY X-IT WILL BE , X-WE WILL SEE ."
X-I DO DESC-NOT WANT TO DESC-EXPRESS ANY PREFERENCE DESC-NOW .
DESC-SECOND BE THAT GERMANY BE RECEIVE COMPLIMENT FROM UNITE KINGDOM .
"CHRI DAVY , DESC-MANY THANKS !"
THAT DESC-ALSO DO DESC-NOT HAPPEN EVERY DAY .
X-IT BE DESC-CERTAINLY WORTH NOTE .
"DESC-HOWEVER , CONGRATULATION TO X-WE DUTCH FRIEND , COURSE ."
X-I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TWO ASPECT DEBATE TO WHICH X-I HAVE DESC-JUST BE DESC-ABLE TO LISTEN .
DESC-FIRST BE THAT X-I UNDERSTAND ALL WORRY AND WOE X-MY DESC-EASTERN EUROPEAN FRIEND DESC-ONLY DESC-TOO DESC-WELL .
"AS DESC-EAST GERMAN , X-I BE DESC-ALSO HALF DESC-EASTERN EUROPEAN ."
"IN ORDER TO GET DESC-HIGH LEVEL DESC-ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION , ONE HAVE TO BE DESC-ABLE TO AFFORD X-IT ."
"DESC-YES , THAT BE DESC-TRUE ."
X-WE MUST DEAL WITH FACT THAT DESC-INDUSTRIAL PROCESS IN ASIA BE DESC-ALWAYS DESC-CHEAPER THAN DESC-HERE .
THOSE WHICH DO DESC-NOT DO THIS WILL BECOME DESC-LESS DESC-COMPETITIVE .
"NO ONE , INCLUDE THIS LAW , BE DEMAND THAT DESC-INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISE SHOULD BE SWITCH OFF TOMORROW ."
"X-WE HAVE DESC-ENOUGH DESC-TRANSITIONAL PERIOD , BUT TO SAY THAT X-WE MUST GO WITHOUT FOR DESC-COMPETITIVE REASON BE DESC-FALSE ."
"MR KRAHMER , CONGRATULATION ON X-YOU DESC-EXCELLENT WORK ."
DEBATE BE DESC-CLOSE .
"VOTE WILL TAKE PLACE TOMORROW , WEDNESDAY , 7 JULY 2010 , AT 12 00 ."
WRITE STATEMENT RULE 149
X-I WISH TO DESC-WELCOME TRIALOGUE CONDUCT ON SUBJECT PROPOSAL FOR DESC-INDUSTRIAL EMISSION DIRECTIVE .
"AT MOMENT , X-WE BE WITNESS TENTATIVE DEVELOPMENT ALTERNATIVE ENERGY RESOURCE IN DESC-CERTAIN REGION ."
THIS MAINTAIN DESC-CONSIDERABLE DEPENDENCY ON FOSSIL FUEL .
X-WE MUST FIND SOLUTION ENABLE X-WE TO INVEST IN STATE ART ENERGY PRODUCTION FACILITY IN DESC-LEAST POLLUTE WAY DESC-POSSIBLE .
DESC-INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY REQUIRE DESC-HIGH LEVEL DESC-ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION .
"THIS BE DESC-PARTICULARLY DESC-TRUE FOR PREVENTION AIR AND WATER POLLUTION , BUT DESC-ALSO FOR BIODIVERSITY ."
DESC-MAIN STRATEGY EMERGE AS RESULT BE TO COMBAT DESC-ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION AT SOURCE .
X-IT BE DESC-ALSO REQUEST TO SUPPORT AND MONITOR MEMBER STATE IN IMPLEMENT MEASURE .
"IN THIS REGARD , COOPERATION WITH EUROPEAN CONFEDERATION INDUSTRY , SME AND NGO PLAY DESC-IMPORTANT ROLE ."
"DESC-HOWEVER , X-IT SHOULD BE EMPHASISE THAT DESC-NOT ALL MEMBER STATE BE DESC-ABLE TO IMPLEMENT X-IT ."
LOSS TO INDUSTRY MAY BE AS DESC-HIGH AS PLN 50 BILLION .
IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE WILL DESC-ALSO HAVE DESC-ADVERSE EFFECT ON THOUSAND POLISH BUSINESS .
THIS BE FOUR YEAR DESC-SHORTER THAN POLAND HAVE EXPECT .
EXTEND DESC-TRANSITIONAL PERIOD WOULD MAKE DESC-TECHNOLOGICAL CONVERSION DESC-EASIER FOR DESC-SMALL HEATING PLANT .
INTRODUCTION DIRECTIVE WILL DESC-ALSO AFFECT LIFE DESC-ORDINARY CITIZEN .
"IN VIEW ABOVE , RECOMMENDATION FOR DESC-SECOND READING DESC-INDUSTRIAL EMISSION DIRECTIVE SHOULD BE REJECT ."

"PARLIAMENT WOULD HAVE LIKE BAN ON DESC-ENTIRE CHAIN , AND DESC-NOT DESC-JUST DESC-FIRST SELLER ."
ALL PARTY MUST DESC-REFORE TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENSURE THAT NO DESC-ILLEGAL TIMBER BE SELL IN EU .
MOST DESC-BLATANT BREACH BAN ON SALE DESC-ILLEGAL TIMBER SHOULD BE TREAT AS CRIME .
X-WE EXAMINE SORT CONTEXT IN WHICH THIS CONCEPT OCCUR IN DESC-CURRENT LEGISLATION .
DESC-ILLEGAL HARVESTING DESC-ALSO DESTROY BIODIVERSITY .
FOREST BE DESC-VITAL IMPORTANCE IN MAINTAIN BIODIVERSITY AND IN DESC-GLOBAL CLIMATE AND WATER CYCLE .
DESC-NOWHERE BE THREE PILLAR DESC-SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT DESC-CLEARER THAN IN RELATION TO FOREST .
CHALLENGE REMAIN AS TO HOW X-WE DETECT DESC-ILLEGALLY HARVEST TIMBER .
PROPOSAL IN FRONT X-YOU DESERVE X-YOU SUPPORT .
X-IT DESC-CERTAINLY HAVE MINE .
"MR PRESIDENT , DESC-FIRST ALL , X-I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MR HASS X-I AND DESC-OR SHADOW RAPPORTEUR ."
"DESC-HOWEVER , X-I MUST SAY THAT X-WE WORK DESC-WELL DESC-TOGER ."
X-I WOULD DESC-ALSO LIKE TO THANK SPANISH PRESIDENCY .
X-I HAVE THREE THING IN MIND WHEN WORK ON THIS ISSUE .
"DESC-FIRSTLY , THAT TIMBER BE DESC-WONDERFUL AND DESC-RENEWABLE MATERIAL THAT X-WE USE DESC-TOO DESC-LITTLE DESC-RAR THAN DESC-TOO DESC-MUCH ."
"X-WE MUST DESC-NOT IMPOSE DESC-HIGHER REQUIREMENT ON TIMBER THAN X-WE DO ON OIL , FOR EXAMPLE ."
"DESC-SECONDLY , X-IT MUST BE DESC-POSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT LEGISLATION ."
EXPORT TIMBER AND TIMBER PRODUCT BE DESC-IMPORTANT FACTOR IN SWEDEN BECOME DESC-RICH DESC-ONCE UPON TIME .
X-WE MUST DESC-NOT PREVENT DESC-OR COUNTRY THAT BE DESC-CURRENTLY DESC-POOR FROM EXPORT AND TRADING .
"DESC-MANY X-MY OBJECTION HAVE BE HEAR , FOR WHICH X-I BE DESC-VERY DESC-GRATEFUL ."
X-I THINK THAT X-WE HAVE ACHIEVE DESC-GREAT DEAL .
X-I SEE DESC-MANY FRIEND DESC-HERE WHO FIGHT DESC-HARD WITH X-WE .
THIS BE DESC-ABSOLUTELY DESC-ABSURD .
"DESC-HOWEVER , THIS LEGISLATION PROTECT EUROPEAN CITIZEN AND EUROPEAN PRODUCER FROM DESC-UNFAIR COMPETITION FROM DESC-CHEAP DESC-ILLEGAL TIMBER ."
X-IT BE DESC-ALSO BECAUSE TODAY X-WE BE SEND DESC-VERY DESC-STRONG SIGNAL TO REST WORLD .
"THIS BE DESC-VERY DESC-IMPORTANT SIGNAL ON PART EUROPEAN UNION , AND SHOULD DESC-NOT BE UNDERESTIMATE ."
"DEFORESTATION BOTH DESC-LEGAL AND , IN DESC-PARTICULAR , DESC-ILLEGAL REMAIN DESC-MAJOR PROBLEM IN WORLD ."
"DESC-FAIR BE DESC-FAIR , DESC-HOWEVER THIS SIGNAL BE DESC-ACTUALLY DESC-ONLY DESC-EFFECTIVE THANKS TO EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ."
"AS DESC-FAR AS X-I BE CONCERN , THIS BE DESC-GREAT VICTORY FOR DEMOCRACY ."
"DESC-UNFORTUNATELY , IF X-IT BE DESC-NOT ENFORCE DESC-EFFECTIVELY , X-IT WILL BE PAPER TIGER ."
THIS DESC-ALSO GO FOR SHADOW RAPPORTEUR .
"IN X-MY OPINION , PARLIAMENT HAVE SET EXAMPLE HOW X-IT CAN OPERATE AND DESC-EXPRESS X-ITS DESC-DEMOCRATIC POWER ."
X-IT HAVE BE PLEASURE WORK WITH X-SHE .
X-I BE DESC-VERY DESC-HAPPY TO HAVE BE PART DESC-SUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATION TO DESC-SECURE AGREEMENT .
X-WE WOULD DO DESC-WELL DESC-NOT TO UNDERESTIMATE SUCCESS DESC-RE .
X-IT BE DESC-POSSIBLE TO COME TO DESC-SUCH AGREEMENT WHEN X-WE ALL WORK DESC-TOGER .
X-I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT ONE DESC-VERY DESC-WELCOME SIDE EFFECT .
X-IT FOLLOW ON DESC-NICELY FROM WHAT JAN BE DESC-JUST SAY .
"MR PRESIDENT , COMMISSIONER , X-I WOULD DESC-ALSO LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANK RAPPORTEUR THIS DESC-EXCELLENT WORK ."
X-WE BE DESC-REFORE DESC-ALSO TALK ABOUT TRANSFER WEALTH FROM PRODUCER TO COUNTRY CONSUMING THIS TIMBER .
THIS DESC-ILLEGAL PRACTICE PLACE DESC-SUSTAINABLE TIMBER EXPLOITATION AND COMPANY INVOLVE IN X-IT AT RISK .
DESC-NICE SOUND WORD BE DESC-NOT DESC-ENOUGH .
PARLIAMENT MUST ADOPT DESC-STRONG AND DESC-CONSISTENT MEASURE IN THIS FIGHT .
THIS REPORT TAKE DESC-VERY DESC-IMPORTANT STEP IN THIS DIRECTION BY DEFINE PROHIBITION ON TIMBER TRADING .
DESC-GOOD INTENTION BE DESC-NOT DESC-ENOUGH EIR .
"DESC-EFFECTIVE MEANS BE NEED , DESC-PARTICULARLY PENALTY , WHICH COULD BE THREE TYPE IN THIS CASE ."
"DESC-HOWEVER , HOW DESC-FAR DESC-BACK SHOULD X-WE TRACE TIMBER , AND WHICH PRODUCT BE X-IT DESC-REALISTIC TO CHECK ?"
"X-I BE THINK ABOUT FURNITURE CONSIST MDF AND CHIPBOARD THAT BE MAKE DESC-RECYCLED WOOD , FOR EXAMPLE ."
"X-I HOPE THAT , WITH THIS PROPOSAL , X-WE WILL BE DESC-ABLE TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPEN ."
X-I HOPE THAT COMMISSION WILL PUT DESC-FORWARD PROPOSAL RELATE TO THIS AS DESC-SOON AS DESC-POSSIBLE .
"X-IT BE DESC-IMPORTANT FOR X-WE CITIZEN , JUDGE BY X-MY POSTBAG AND NUMBER E MAIL X-I HAVE RECEIVE ."
NO WONDER DESC-ILLEGAL LOG FUEL CRIMINALITY IN MADAGASCAR .
"DESC-CIVIL WAR IN LIBERIUM , DESC-MAINLY FUND THROUGH DESC-ILLEGAL LOG , KILL 250 000 PEOPLE ."
X-IT FUEL WAR IN CAMBODIUM IN 1990 AND X-IT BE ENEMY DEMOCRACY .
DESC-HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH SAY THAT USD 2 BILLION HAVE BE LOSE IN TAX REVENUE IN INDONESIUM .
DESC-SO WHAT X-WE BE DO TODAY BE DESC-FIRST STEP .
X-I WOULD LIKE TO THANK COMMISSIONER FOR GO DESC-FURR THAN X-HE PREDECESSOR .

"X-IT CAN BE DO , AND DESC-HERE X-WE HAVE PROOF X-IT ."
"THIS BE DESC-EXCELLENT , THIS BE DESC-GOOD NEWS AND DESC-IMPORTANT MEASURE ."
"DESC-HOWEVER , THIS DIRECTIVE REQUIRE THAT MEMBER STATE INTRODUCE ENFORCEMENT REGIME WHICH BE DESC-EFFECTIVE , PROPORTIONATE AND DISSUASIVE ."
WHAT DO THAT MEAN ?
"ONE SEE WORDSEFFECTIVE , PROPORTIONATE , DISSUASIVETIME AND TIME DESC-AGAIN ."
X-I WOULD LIKE X-YOU TO BE DESC-FIRST COMMISSIONER TO DESC-ACTUALLY ENSURE THAT THOSE WORD HAVE DESC-PROPER EFFECT .
"DE MR PRESIDENT , X-I THINK THAT X-WE BE MAKE DESC-GOOD LEGISLATION TODAY ."
X-IT WOULD BE DESC-MUCH DESC-TOO DESC-BUREAUCRATIC TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE ORIGIN THROUGHOUT DESC-ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAIN WITHIN EUROPE .
THIS BE ON TABLE AT BEGIN DEBATE .
"DESC-REFORE , X-WE MUST BE DESC-MODERATE IN THIS AREA AND ENSURE BALANCE ."
X-WE HAVE SUCCEED IN DO THIS .
"THIS BE DESC-NOT DESC-ONLY DESC-APPLICABLE TO FALL , AND X-IT WILL DESC-NOT WORK ."
ZERO RISK BE DESC-NOT DESC-FEASIBLE .
"X-IT PRODUCE BUREAUCRACY AND , ABOVE ALL , PRODUCE DESC-NEW RISK ."
