"The lapse of the written declaration can be seen in the minute."
"The text of the agreement, described and forwarded by the council, can be seen in the minute."
"See the minute for the submission of oral questions and written declarations."
"See the minute for the transfer of appropriations."
"Order of business."
"By agreement with the political group, I would like to propose the following change."
"The president cut off the speaker."
"Mr. Borghesio, this is not a point of order, since we are talking about a plenary session."
"This is almost without precedent."
"I am simply making a legitimate and indeed valid political comment with which the ALDE chair disagrees."
"That is why the microphone was switched off."
"If the European Parliament censors political comments, it ceases to be a Parliament."
"I will reply in writing to the letter you sent me."
"Thursday."
"So, this is about the postponement of the vote."
"We had originally agreed to put it on the agenda on the assumption that everything was in order."
"We therefore ask for the vote on this issue to be postponed."
"Welcome."
"I have some special information for you."
"You are with us at our session."
"Please welcome you."
"Applause."
"Second Vice President of the Pan African Parliament and Chair of the Delegation for Relations with the European Parliament."
"Our parliaments work closely together, and your presence with us today gives us great pleasure."
"I am sure we will have the opportunity to meet again."
"Once again, I warmly welcome you all."
"Preparation for the European Council meeting on the 25th and 26th of March, 2010 - Debate."
"However, Europe is meeting this situation by creating new economic policy tools in all areas."
"It is being done in this way, by coordinating economic policies."
"Moreover, there are quantifiable commitments to the so-called 'fast start'."
"Heads of state or government will largely be dealing with these matters."
"We have challenging tasks ahead of us."
"For these tasks, fresh and forceful backing from the European Parliament is of great importance."
"That support was clearly expressed at different council minister formations."
"But now to the European Council, I believe every European Council must do two things."
"Crisis entails several pressing concerns for communities, workers, and businesses across Europe."
"And, as we know, public finances at the national level are under unprecedented strain."
"The European Union must of course tackle these issues, including financial stability."
"I will come back to this again later."
"Europe must not make the mistake of neglecting the imperative work now to bring about long-term change."
"We have already debated the Europe 2020 strategy together in this Parliament."
"So, this will also be the contribution of the European Council."
"Our level of ambition must be set by the scale of the task ahead."
"We need to show that we have the vision and coherence to act."
"This is why I believe it is so important that the European Council agrees on clear targets this week."
"Targets which the Commission has put on the table have been carefully chosen."
"This is also about the political will to tackle tough problems."
"Of course, targets must be achievable."
"So, we cannot accept the principle of global interdependence and reject it when discussing it at the European level."
"What we are proposing here is a new departure."
"Accepting this approach will be a real test for the European Council."
"I am encouraged by the results of the informal European Council."
"We need to keep this at the top of our agenda."
"So, let us move on from soul searching about Copenhagen and take the initiative once again."
"We need a clear, unified, and ambitious position."
"That is why the Commission has put forward a communication setting out the steps needed to reinvigorate international negotiations."
"At the same time, Commissioner Hedegaard has started setting consultations with our key partners."
"These two areas show vividly how Europeans are looking to the European Union for political leadership and action."
"Let me therefore state our position on this."
"Greece is currently in the process of correcting its excessive government deficit."
"Bringing the deficit down vigorously is crucial and Greece has been taking measures to that effect."
"It should be clear that the creation of such a mechanism will not imply its automatic activation."
"Creating such a mechanism is also a question of responsibility and solidarity."
"Solidarity is a two-way street."
"The world economy needs stability."
"I hope this issue will be resolved in the spirit of responsibility and solidarity."
"That is the European way to do it."
"Applause."
"To what extent are you willing to cooperate, and what is the line you are unwilling to cross?"
"It is in everyone's interest that we guarantee the stability of Europe and the European monetary system."
"This responsibility is for each member state to guarantee accurate and reliable public accounts."
"In other words, yes, Europe must show solidarity with Greece."
"It must ensure that Greece comes through this difficult period."
"Now it remains for Greece to implement this."
"Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis has forced us to change."
"The criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact must be applied, and the Commission must ensure this."
"This House will support it in this difficult task."
"The second change concerns the governance of our public finances."
"Can this continue?"
"I do not think so."
"Such coordination will only make the implementation of solidarity-based principles easier, fairer, and more natural."
"Mr. President, I invite you to take the initiative in this council."
Applause
"Greece has delivered, as reported by the International Herald Tribune."
That's the first point.
Applause
"The President of the Commission rightly spoke about a safety net."
That's not the objective.
Interest rates are usually between 2.5 to 3%.
Applause
This means people are being robbed.
"Speculators will turn their attention to Italy, the UK, and Spain."
"If we don't want to see large scale conflict, we need to demonstrate solidarity with Greece now."
It's not about giving aid for the sake of it.
Applause
"The Commission should propose how we can achieve sensible stabilisation within the Euro area."
The Commission has made good proposals and I believe the council should agree.
This does not include calling on the International Monetary Fund.
Why not?
We are capable of resolving problems within the Euro area ourselves.
"Moreover, I'm astonished that Chancellor Merkel is involving the International Monetary Fund."
That's a quote from the German Bundesbank.
That's not the right way to go.
Speculation won't stop until such a signal has been given.
"This is nothing more than a game where I insure myself against my neighbor's house burning down."
"If my neighbor's house burns down, I receive insurance money."
That's why showing solidarity with Greece is an act to stabilise the Euro in the Euro area.
Applause
"I will continue, Mr. President."
That's how I feel today.
Applause
It's not about that.
There are two elements that matter in terms of knowing what interest rates are: liquidity and credibility.
The only way to resolve this is to take necessary steps to introduce this European instrument.
This is what will happen if firm decisions aren't made during this council.
Applause
That's why Europe must intervene.
Europe must ensure that Greece's consolidation measures are worthwhile.
"They are necessary, but they also need to be worthwhile."
This is what we must hope for.
Yet, it's only now that we are debating the terms on which this assistance is being granted.
I think this is disgraceful.
Applause
The state of Greece must use this crisis to bring about real reform.
"As I've said, the Greek people deserve much better."
"We will have a lot to do, and things will turn bitter once again, Mr. Langen."
We need to explain the necessity of integration to our citizens.
We have made this as significant as when discussing the constitution.
The necessity to integrate economic policy is what needs to be discussed from now on.
"Otherwise, as Mr. MÃ¼nchau wrote today, Chancellor Merkel will return defeated from Brussels before long."
The Bild Zeitung will write that the Euro must be abolished and we must bring back the Deutsche Mark.
What will we do then?
It's not too late.
Germany is in a decisive position.
I hope that Mr. Sarkozy won't give in and will be more sensible than Chancellor Merkel.
"In this chamber, I would like to express approval for the Greek government."
"It's a government which is facing protests on its streets today."
The debate on the EU 2020 economic strategy is already on the agenda.
We want a strategy for Europe that prioritizes social and ecological needs over competitive interests.
EU 2020 is far from this.
I hope this attitude won't prevail among the majority of government heads.
"Mr. President, my country, Greece, has many things in common with California."
The speaker is interrupted by a heckler.
"Yes, it's the economy."
I realize that.
That's why I said what I did earlier.
Or would the central administration of the USA resolve its problems?
Do we or do we not have a central administration in the European Union?
Have we seen through the cohesion of the Euro, and is it threatening the unity of the Union?
We have achieved a single European market.
We have achieved the Euro.
I don't think we've achieved anything else in common.
That's why you also see me with Euro skeptics.
"I trust that tomorrow, we will prove that we have truly achieved harmony and something in common."
All those who spoke before me mentioned solutions to the Greek crisis.
"Meanwhile, Mr. Barroso, the summit hasn't even placed it on its agenda."
"Don't you see this as a contradiction, as hypocrisy?"
Because it doesn't appear on the official agenda.
"Of course, it's not just Greece that found itself in a difficult situation in 2008. An IMF loan was accepted there, a move that had extremely serious consequences for the population."
We need to face the question of what lessons the financial crisis has taught us.
Is it that everything is connected to everything else?
No.
Wall Street fell.
Leading the Union means seeking solutions for Greece.
Everyone has said so, and I won't repeat it.
Tougher sanctions would also have to be implemented so that agreements truly appear binding.
What else does it involve?
Tell us what it involves and we'll help you.
The conclusion talks about a timely exit from exceptional support measures.
What does that mean in practice?
We feel that the timetable is hopelessly optimistic.
It's a recipe for disaster.
We need a sustainable social and sustainable exit strategy.
The Danish Labor Institute has produced figures today.
This can be avoided.
We have to avoid it.
"By the way, this week, we are also proposing a new European mechanism for financial stability."
"If implemented as it stands, Europe 2020 will be another Lisbon Strategy failure."
Europe should instead dare to tackle these challenges head-on with bold governance proposals.
"Firstly, the open coordination method is not working and must be abandoned."
An open process would create transparency and permit citizen involvement.
"As European politicians, we should always strive to put citizens at the center of our policies."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"In other words, this means that until 2020, the equalisation of economic disparities will be less dynamic."
Thank you.
"Madam President, I think we've dealt sufficiently and fairly with the issue of Greece."
I would like to touch on issues that also concern other countries.
Mr. Schulz said that interest rates currently stand at 2-3% in Europe.
